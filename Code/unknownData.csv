Technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MAY 9, 2018   Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • How well did Flipkart’s investors do? • What did AT&T and Novartis want from Michael Cohen? • Walmart finally announced a deal to buy control of Flipkart for about $16 billion. • What the U.S.’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal means for the business world. • The bottom line on Vodafone’s big deal with Liberty Global. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. The story of Walmart’s $16 billion deal for Flipkart began nearly two years ago and spanned secret negotiations in both Bentonville, Ark., and Bangalore, India. Here’s an account of how it came together based on interviews by people involved in the transaction, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the deal. Driving the deal was the retail giant’s push to bolster its presences in e-commerce and emerging markets like India. In recent years, Walmart had bought Jet.com and Bonobos. The giant American retailer also had moved to combine its Asda supermarket chain in Britain with a local rival to allow Walmart to focus its attention elsewhere. Advertisement Walmart had initially approached Flipkart in 2016. But it quickly backed away to focus on its $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, one of these people said. Advertisement By last November, Walmart was ready to discuss a deal. Initially, Walmart was focused on acquiring a minority stake in Flipkart, these people said. But over time, both sides came to realize that Flipkart could better realize its ambitions if Walmart owned a majority stake. From a business perspective, Flipkart would provide a base for e-commerce dominance in India, while Walmart could give a crucial boost in the grocery delivery business. Walmart could also provide a permanent base of capital, which would allow Flipkart to avoid raising money every few years. For its part, Walmart would feel more comfortable if it had majority control, even as it was prepared to give Flipkart’s management some degree of independence. In December, Amazon entered the fray, these people said. The e-commerce titan sought to buy Flipkart outright. But Flipkart was wary. It worried regulators would block a deal that would have combined India’s two biggest e-commerce services. Discussions with Walmart pressed forward. Over the next few months, the boards of Walmart and Flipkart refined what became Wednesday’s deal: The size of the stake Walmart would buy and at what price. They also settled on which of Flipkart’s investors would sell. Some, including the investment firm Tiger Global Management and the Chinese internet giant Tencent, wanted to stay on board, betting that Flipkart would continue to grow. Others, including the nearly $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, were happy to cash out. — Michael J. de la Merced Walmart’s agreement to buy a 77 percent stake in Flipkart for $16 billion — or a $20.8 billion valuation — is the American retail giant’s biggest takeover in years. And it’s set to give some of the Indian e-commerce company’s investors a healthy return. Here’s how well some of them did: • Accel, which was one of Flipkart’s original investors, will be one of the biggest winners, according to a person with knowledge of its investment who was not authorized to talk publicly about them. The firm made a sevenfold return on its investments in Flipkart. That includes a return of 71 times at Accel’s India fund. • Tiger Global Management, which first invested in Flipkart’s Series A and poured about $1 billion into the company, according to a person with knowledge of its investment but was not authorized to talk publicly about it. Overall return: 4 times Advertisement • Naspers, the South African media investor that first invested in Flipkart in 2012 and has poured $616 million, sold out at $2.2 billion, according to Bloomberg. Overall return: 3.6 times • SoftBank, which invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August through its Vision Fund, is selling out at a $4 billion valuation, according to its founder, Masa Son. Overall return: 60 percent Some investors who are keeping stakes in Flipkart — including Tiger Global, which will maintain a roughly 5 percent stake, Microsoft and the Chinese internet giant Tencent — could continue to reap returns should Flipkart eventually go public. — Michael J. de la Merced What exactly were AT&T and Novartis after when they made payments to a firm set up Michael Cohen, President Trump’s personal lawyer? A new report from Bloomberg sheds more light on what AT&T wanted. AT&T told its employees in an email sent Wednesday that the company hired Mr. Cohen’s firm, Essential Consultants, to get insights on how the administration might conduct antitrust enforcement, among other things, according to Bloomberg. AT&T is hoping to merge with Time Warner, a deal Mr. Trump has sharply criticized. His administration is now suing to stop the merger. AT&T paid Essential Consultations $200,000 in four payments, according to documents reviewed by the New York Times. AT&T, in a statement Tuesday, said: “Essential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.” And AT&T may have paid Mr. Cohen a lot more than $200,000. CNBC, citing an unnamed source, on Wednesday reported that AT&T’s contract with Mr. Cohen allowed for payments up to $600,000. Plenty of questions remain: How did AT&T and Novartis get introduced to Mr. Cohen? Why would the companies want insights from someone who was not known for his policy expertise? And did Mr. Cohen say that he had a special connection with Mr. Trump that could yield information? Advertisement - Peter Eavis Walmart reached a $16 billion deal to buy a majority stake in Flipkart, India’s leading e-commerce platform. Details • Walmart will buy an initial stake of 77 percent in Flipkart and invest $2 billion in fresh capital into the Indian firm. • The two companies said they are in continuing talks with other investors to purchase a stake, which might reduce Walmart’s eventual shareholding in Flipkart. • Walmart said the purchase would reduce its net income by at least $750 million this year and by more than double that amount next year. It’s a risky bet for Walmart • Walmart has repeatedly stumbled in its e-commerce efforts in the United States. • Although India’s population is rapidly coming online, the number of people with enough income to shop online is still tiny. • Walmart is paying a hefty premium to buy its way into the pole position in India’s e-commerce market, but it has not yet outlined any strategy that would keep it ahead of Amazon there. • While Flipkart is currently the market leader, Amazon’s relatively new India site is quickly closing the gap. Advertisement The big winners • Sachin Bansal. Flipkart's co-founder, is selling his entire 5.5 percent stake in the company, becoming an instant billionaire. • SoftBank Vision Fund, the investment vehicle run by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August. That the stake will now be sold for about $4 billion. The advisers • Walmart was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays on the banking side and Hogan Lovells, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher on the legal side. • Flipkart was advised by Goldman Sachs and law firms Gunderson Dettmer LLP, Khaitan & Co., Allen & Gledhill LLP and Dentons Rodyk & Davidson Critic’s Corner Una Galani of Breakingviews writes:  “After buying Jet.com for $3 billion a couple years ago, Walmart’s efforts to compete online in the United States have hit some bumps. Earlier misadventures in China prompted it to join forces with local rival JD.com in return for a small stake. India will test the U.S. company’s ability to keep pace halfway around the world with Amazon, whose investors are as patient as boss Jeff Bezos. This will be a make-or-break overseas deal for Walmart.” Sturm Ruger had urged shareholders for weeks to reject a proposal from a group of Roman Catholic nuns demanding more transparency from the company on whether it planned to develop safer products and monitor the ones already in circulation. On Wednesday, a majority of investors sided with the nuns. The vote was a rebuke to the company’s leaders and a victory for gun control activists. Ruger must now produce a report by February on how it tracks violence associated with its firearms, what kind of research it is conducting related to so-called smart gun technology and its assessment of the risks that gun-related crimes pose to the company’s reputation and finances. — Tiffany Hsu ZTE, one of China’s most internationally successful technology suppliers, is facing a death sentence, reports Raymond Zhong of the NYT. Advertisement The United States Department of Commerce has blocked it from accessing American-made components until 2025, saying the company failed to punish employees who violated trade controls against Iran and North Korea. ZTE said on Wednesday it had ceased “major operating activities.” Trading in ZTE’s shares has been suspended for weeks, and its staff have been instructed, in new company guidelines reviewed by The New York Times, to reassure anxious clients — while being sure to avoid discussing with them the American technology from which the company is cut off for the next seven years. The stock is up 22 percent Wednesday after the struggling department store chain said it is collaborating with Amazon to provide tire installation. Sears said it will provide customers who purchase any brand of tire on Amazon, including the Sears DieHard brand and full-service tire installation and balancing.

The service initially will available at 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. This the second partnership that Sears has struck with Amazon in the past year. Last July, Sears said it would sell its Kenmore appliances of Amazon. The announcement pushed Sears’s shares up 24 percent. The stock is down more than 70 percent over the past 12 months. Washington was abuzz yesterday with the news that Michael Cohen’s Essential Consultants received $500,000 from an investment fund tied to the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. But AT&T and Novartis were also shown to have paid money to the firm — the one that Mr. Cohen used to pay Stormy Daniels. AT&T said Essential was “one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,” and that its contract ended in December. Novartis said that its contract ran for a year, through February. Advertisement There’s no link between AT&T or Novartis and the investigations into Mr. Cohen. But AT&T does have business before the Trump administration, including its $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner. What an unnamed source told the WSJ: “Right around [when the] inauguration is happening, we need somebody who knows the administration,” the person said. “How does he think? What are their priorities?” The Atlantic notes that AT&T’s $200,000 payouts to Essential Consultants put it in the middle of the telecom giant’s overall lobbying expenses for last year. The price of benchmark American crude oil rose to more than $71 early Wednesday. The move higher comes a day after President Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, as investors weighed the potential loss of Iranian crude oil to global supplies. Oil prices are hovering near highs not seen since 2014 would seem to run counter to the President’s stated, or tweeted, preference for lower oil prices. But as American oil production has surged, the traditional view that higher oil prices act as a clear drag on American growth has become less of an item of faith.              Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!         With President Trump making good on his threat to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, the business world has been grappling with what to do next. European companies like Total were considering whether to abandon investments — their governments promised unspecified protections — while Boeing and G.E. were also caught in the crossfire. Meanwhile, oil continued to rise as the U.S. warned buyers to curb purchases from Iran within six months. (Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional rival, said it would help stabilize markets.) Peter Eavis’s take: While Mr. Trump’s foreign policies haven’t yet caused serious losses in the stock market, investors’ stoicism could face greater tests soon. Earnings growth for corporate America this year probably peaked in the first quarter. And since neither the E.U. nor China looks close to caving to Mr. Trump’s threats, global trade tensions look set to escalate. The big question: How hard will the U.S. crack down on allies who don’t go along with sanctions — is this another trade fight? Elsewhere in Iran news: Peter Thiel’s Palantir was helping monitor Iran. Some cybersecurity experts fear Iran will now hack more. In agreeing to buy Liberty Global’s cable networks in Germany and Eastern Europe for $22 billion, the British telecom giant is making the biggest move yet to consolidate the Continent’s internet industry. Vodafone won’t just be in wireless: It will offer high-speed internet and cable to 54 million customers. Advertisement Why this matters, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase (via the FT): We believe this event is a bellwether for the sector, and could potentially contribute toward a flurry of consolidation across Europe.

Technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin JAN. 9, 2018  Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Kodak plans to create its own virtual currency. • President Trump plans to attend the World Economic Forum. • Just how rich is Jeff Bezos? • The shine is coming off the tech industry more and more.  • Talk of an Oprah presidential run has boosted at least one company.  Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Shares of Kodak surged 34 percent after the company said it said it was launching a “major blockchain initiative.” The company and WENN Digital announced the creation of KODAKOne, an image rights management platform, and KODAKCoin, a virtual token “to allow photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.” Advertisement “For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,” said Jeff Clarke, Kodak’s chief executive. Advertisement Erik Holm of MoneyBeat writes: “For the past several years, people have been experimenting with ways to adapt the technology behind bitcoin, usually called blockchain. At its essence, blockchain is an open record of transactions, maintained in an online ledger that is distributed across a network of computers, that cannot be tampered with. That makes it like an indelible timestamp, which could be useful in a case of copyright and digital rights management.” Kodak plans to hold an initial coin offering for KODAKCoin on Jan. 31. Coin offerings, which allow companies to raise money by creating their own private digital currency through a form of online crowdfunding, have surged in popularity during the past 12 months. Kodak’s shares are just the latest to get a digital currency boost. The stocks of a number of companies have surged in recent months after those firms rebranded themselves as having something to do digital currencies or blockchain. Critic’s corner: Kodak is “betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering designed to help photographers sell their work. The crypto buzz more than doubled its stock, but it’s unlikely to do anything like the same to the company’s sales or profit,” writes Tom Buerkle of Breakingviews. — Stephen Grocer The chief executive of Renault-Nissan has escalated the auto industry’s technology-driven arms race. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance said Tuesday it is setting up a venture capital fund to invest $1 billion in automotive technologies over the next five years. Mr. Ghosn pushed for the fund “to speed development of technologies that the three automakers don’t have in-house,” the WSJ reported. More about the fund: • It’s named Alliance Ventures. • Francois Dossa is leading the fund and will have teams in Silicon Valley, Paris, Japan and China looking for startups in which to invest. • The fund has already invested in Ionic Materials, a Woburn, Mass., startup working to develop solid-state batteries. Advertisement Automakers have poured money into automobile technology startups in recent years. General Motors bought Cruise Automation in a deal potentially valued at more than $1 billion. Last summer Toyota set up a $100 million investing arm called Toyota AI Ventures. From Reuters: “The traditional auto industry model based on individual ownership is threatened by pay-per-use services such as Uber, as well as ride- and car-sharing platforms, a challenge heightened by parallel shifts towards electrified and self-driving cars.” Stephen Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, was ousted from his post as executive chairman at Breitbart News, the right-wing website he used as a mouthpiece. From The New York Times: Stephen K. Bannon is stepping down from his post as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the company announced Tuesday. Mr. Bannon’s departure, which was forced by a onetime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, comes as Mr. Bannon remained unable to quell the furor over remarks attributed to him in a new book in which he questions President Trump’s mental fitness and disparages his elder son, Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Bannon’s departure from the website is the latest ignominious turn in a career that was once one of the most promising and improbable in modern American politics. Here’s what White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Maggie Haberman and Michael Shear of the NYT: “At this year’s World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries, and American workers.” He’ll be the first U.S. president to do so since Bill Clinton in 2000. The BBC previously noted that Ronald Reagan spoke to the crowd at the World Economic Forum via videoconference, but that neither of the Bushes nor Barack Obama attended. (Joe Biden did, however.) Why? As the NYT adds, presidents have been concerned that being seen rubbing shoulders with some of the world’s wealthiest might send the wrong political message. (Other heads of state, like Xi Jinping of China, have attended.) One additional note: Having attended the forum a few times, I’d say that one thing that a visit from Mr. Trump would definitely do is make the traffic in Davos during the event — which often moves at a glacial pace as V.I.P.’s vehicular escorts crawl through the windy streets — probably more difficult. — Michael J. de la Merced Shot: “Jeff Bezos is now the richest person of all time,” CNN reported. (The Bloomberg article that the news item cited makes no such claim.) Chaser:               Sorry, this just isn't accurate. Fugger, the 16th century banker, was worth $400bn in 2010 $s. Rockefeller $330bn+ Carnegie $300bn+ https://t.co/0uvtivrtsv  — Michael J. de la Merced Let’s count the ways: • Apple is being pressed to protect young users from smartphone addiction by an unusual coalition: the hedge fund Jana Partners and the California public pension fund Calstrs. • Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter are under scrutiny over Russia’s use of social media to manipulate elections. • Amazon is facing scrutiny for its effect on jobs. • Europe is examining many U.S. tech companies on competition and privacy grounds. Advertisement As Barry Rosenstein, the managing partner of Jana, told David Gelles of the NYT: “As more and more founders of the biggest tech companies are acknowledging today, the days of just throwing technology out there and washing your hands of the potential impact are over.” The growing fear about tech addiction: Two former Facebook executives, Sean Parker and Chamath Palihapitiya, spoke last year about how the company hooks into users’ psyches. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, held a briefing on the issue. (Axios has more.) One place you don’t yet see a problem: These companies’ stocks. Apple’s shares dipped only slightly yesterday, and its market capitalization is still just shy of $900 billion. Shares in Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter gained slightly. Critics’ corner • Shira Ovide writes, “When financial mercenaries start caring about the potential human harm of technology, Silicon Valley should be extremely nervous.” (Gadfly) • Jennifer Saba writes of Jana’s campaign, “It’s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets.” (Breakingviews) Shares in the weight-loss company, of which Ms. Winfrey owns 10 percent, jumped as much as 13 percent yesterday amid speculation that she may run for president. Not everyone was as euphoric about the possibility. Here’s what Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist, told the NYT: “Beating Trump isn’t just about finding the right candidate — we have to show what we stand for,” Ms. Katz said. “Other than ‘we all get a car,’ what will an Oprah presidency look like?” she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show. It comes down to how they respond to the provision that taxes the income of overseas subsidiaries at half the domestic rate — even as Mr. Trump has promised to bring jobs back to struggling cities. Companies have a new reason to move plants abroad, Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT reports: “Having such a low rate on foreign income is outrageous,” said Stephen E. Shay, a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School and a Treasury Department official during the Reagan and Obama administrations. “It creates terrible incentives.” The caveat: Some companies may want to stay, for America’s legal system and skilled workers. But big manufacturers like auto companies may be tempted to move anyway. More in taxes • Mr. Trump celebrated the passing of the tax overhaul in Nashville, where he overstated the size of the cuts. (NYT) Advertisement • Residents of high-tax states rushed to prepay their bills before deductions are capped, giving those areas a welcome, if brief, revenue boost.

Advertisement More from Brad Plumer of the NYT: Last year, utilities announced plans to shut down more than 22 gigawatts of coal capacity across the country, and more retirements are expected this year.

Its founder and C.E.O., Nick Woodman, cut his cash salary to $1. The company’s shares climbed back amid news reports that it had hired JPMorgan Chase to run a sales process. But Mr. Woodman eventually told Bloomberg that while JPMorgan is the company’s main bank, GoPro wasn’t actively looking to sell itself. GoPro’s problem: It’s too dependent on its action cameras, according to Dan Gallagher of Heard on the Street. Some investors have apparently decided that protecting themselves against a decline in the markets is a waste of money, Gunjan Banerji of the WSJ reports: “I haven’t seen hedging activity this light since the end of the financial crisis,” said Peter Cecchini, a New York-based chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “It started in late 2016 and accelerated in the second half of the year.” At the same time, analysts have raised their forecasts for corporate profits as fast as they have in a decade. History suggests that might presage a slump. “That’s made it the best penny stock and the worst currency in the world.” — Matt O’Brien of the WaPo, writing about why Bitcoin is doing well as a speculative investment and terribly as a way to buy and sell things.

Business,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin APRIL 18, 2018  Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Morgan Stanley reported a 42 percent jump in first-quarter profit. • The will-he-or-won’t-he Trump trade policy • Will Google become the next target of privacy inquiries? Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. The world needs a way to tell whether President Trump wants to pursue his combative trade policies. The Trump administration has in recent weeks announced a barrage of trade actions. First, Mr. Trump said he was imposing tariffs against steel and aluminum imports from a range of countries. Then came announcements of actions against China that included tariffs on a large number of products. Very few restrictions have come into effect, though. President Trump has allowed temporary exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs. The moves against China have to go through a public comment process before they can take place. Advertisement Investors, executives and farmers who have concerns about the economic impact of the trade actions may like that little has so far happened. And they may hope that Mr. Trump uses the leeway he has under trade law to step back from his threats. But supporters of tougher trade policies will be watching closely to see if Mr. Trump actually carries them out. Advertisement In the coming months, there are a number of important dates at which the Trump administration has to decide whether it wants to retreat, delay, negotiate, fight on or escalate. To help assess the stance of the United State in this trade standoff, DealBook has compiled these dates. Before looking ahead, it’s important to note that the Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on some countries. On March 23, tariffs were applied to imports of steel and aluminum from countries that were not granted an exemption. Those currently enjoying the reprieve are Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea, Brazil and members of the European Union. The next big deadline is May 1, which is when the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs expire. Between now and then, members of the Trump administration have to decide whether they want to take an action that could upset staunch allies of the United States. The United States may extend the exemptions if discussions occur or make them permanent if, say, countries agree to side with the United States in its trade offensive against China. But holding off on the steel and aluminum tariffs for a long time might embolden China, which the United States has targeted with separate actions that focus on China alone. These include two sets of tariffs, one on $50 billion of goods and a threated second set on products worth $100 billion, as well as an action at the World Trade Organization. The administration can’t announce a final list of goods for the $50 billion of tariffs until May 22. That is when the period for public responses to the tariffs ends. Trade law gives President Trump the power to then impose the tariffs quickly, but it also provides him significant flexibility on the timing. The trade legislation states that the United States would have to act within 12 months of the date at which the United States trade representative initiated its investigation of Chinese trade practices. This implies the Trump administration has until August 18. Advertisement But the legislation suggests it has even more latitude. Once the administration has determined what actions it will take, it can in theory delay putting them into effect by 180 days. Hypothetically, President Trump could stretch things into early next year. Much remains up in the air, though. Mr. Trump has the power to pursue trade policy almost at whim. He could argue for extended exemptions for Canada and Mexico, which are also involved in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. South Korea may also end up with significant tariff exemptions as a result of a trade agreement that country is apparently close to forging with the United States. And that action against China at the World Trade Organization could take years. — Peter Eavis One of Wall Street’s biggest (and nerdiest) contests is between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. With each quarter’s earnings, the banks disclose their return on equity, a number that shows the profitability of the equity capital they have deployed in their businesses. Goldman usually wins. From 2010 until 2017, Morgan Stanley’s annual return on equity was stronger in only two of those eight years, and those two years were not good ones for Wall Street overall. A big test was going to be how these banks fared in unambiguously good conditions, like those that existed in the first quarter of this year, when trading activity was strong and the economic outlook bullish. Goldman’s return on equity in the first quarter was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.9 percent for Morgan Stanley. In other words, Goldman clinched the bragging rights. But with some rounding, they both achieved a 15 percent return. — Peter Eavis The Wall Street firm reported record revenue and profit for the first quarter driven by a jump in trading and the new tax law. • Morgan Stanley reported profits of $2.58 billion, up 40 percent from a year ago. That also topped analysts’ expectations of $2.2 billion in earnings, according to Thomson Reuters. Advertisement • Earnings per share came in at $1.45, beating the $1.25 analysts had expected. • Revenues increased 13.7 percent to $11.08 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $10.36 billion. • Total trading revenue rose 26 percent to $4.40 billion. • Equity trading revenue increased to $2.6 billion, up 30 percent from a year ago • Fixed-income trading revenue rose 9 percent to $1.8 billion. • Fees from investment banking rose 7 percent to $1.51 billion. • Fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions gained 16 percent to $574 million. • Underwriting revenues rose 2 percent. • Wealth management revenues increased 8 percent to $2.37 billion. Bloomberg reports that the latest data from the International Monetary Fund projects U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio to “widen to 116.9 percent by 2023 while Italy’s is seen narrowing to 116.6 percent.” The I.M.F. numbers are just the latest highlighting the negative impact the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts could have on the fiscal outlook of the United States. That seems out — for now, anyway, given President Trump’s tweet from Mar-a-Lago yesterday: “Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work.” Here are a few takeaways about the end of a public flirtation: • Trade partners and allies are again left wondering about the White House’s trade policy. That’s especially pertinent as the U.S. continues to feud with China; yesterday the F.C.C. blocked wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy Chinese telecom equipment. • The tweet put Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who’s at Mar-a-Lago with Mr. Trump, in an awkward position. Japan has been leery of a bilateral trade pact with the U.S., since it risks having to make more concessions than in the TPP with little hope of much in return. Tokyo would like exemptions from potential U.S. tariffs, however. Advertisement Fact-check: Despite Mr. Trump’s tweet, South Korea isn’t in the TPP. Elsewhere in trade: China’s plans to relax foreign ownership rules for carmakers could be great for Elon Musk and bad for Warren Buffett. Or, in Mr. Musk’s case, maybe not. Facebook has born the brunt of fury over the tech industry’s practices, particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal shed light on how user data is shared. But another behemoth’s practices could come under scrutiny, particularly if Democrats take back Congress in the midterm elections. More from Mark Bergen and Ben Brody of Bloomberg: Two years ago, Google altered its offerings in a way that makes it more vulnerable to data-sharing scrutiny. Advertisers using its DoubleClick system to target and measure ads could start anonymously combining web-tracking data (from “cookies” that follow users online) with potent Google information including search queries, location history, phone numbers and credit card information. Until then, Google had steadfastly kept that data separate. Another thought on Google’s weaknesses, from our colleague Mike Isaac: Elsewhere in privacy: Facebook has previewed how its privacy policies are changing to comply with European regulations. Those same rules have emboldened the company to resume face-scanning photographs in Europe — if consumers opt in. Eduardo Porter argues that Facebook is creepy, but still potentially good for you. Justices appeared split yesterday over whether U.S. states could force online retailers to collect sales tax somewhere they had no physical presence.

Wayfair, could upend a decades-old status quo in online retail — and bring states some much-needed revenue. Elsewhere in taxes: Morgan Stanley analysts say they are uncertain whether the Republican tax overhaul will extend the boom in U.S. business. The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers asserts that the changes will benefit American workers the most. President Trump filed for a six-month extension for preparing his income taxes.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters (Reuters) - Pharmaceuticals company Mylan NV said on Thursday that one of its subsidiary received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its compliance with the Trades Agreement Act (TAA) for certain products, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company also said certain employees of Mylan S.p.A. were served with search warrants issued by the public prosecutor's office in Milan, Italy, seeking information concerning interactions with an Italian hospital and sales of certain reimbursable drugs.  The company was not immediately available for additional details outside business hours. Shares of the drugmaker were down 1.2 percent at $37.44 after the bell.  In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial. An investigation was opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS — For the first time since 2004, the Minnesota Timberwolves are entering May without their customary collection of good-luck charms for the NBA draft lottery. The longest-running absence from the playoffs in the league finally over, the Wolves took a significant accomplishment into the summer after their 47-35 record during the regular season tied for the fifth-best in franchise history. ""When you haven't done something for 14 years, it's a major step for our organization, and it's not easy to do. Winning in this league is very difficult, and we should understand that,"" said president of basketball operations and head coach Tom Thibodeau, who joined general manager Scott Layden on Monday for a wrapup news conference. Jimmy Butler and Karl-Anthony Towns gave the Timberwolves multiple representatives at the All-Star game for the first time since Kevin Garnett and Sam Cassell in 2004 on their way to the Western Conference finals. That was the most recent postseason appearance until the first round series with Houston tipped off earlier this month. With 16 out of 41 home games declared sellouts, they had their highest number since 1991-92, and local television ratings were way up, too. Still, in typical Timberwolves fashion, the road to relevancy was not without potholes. Falling in five games to the Rockets was forgivable, considering their opponent had the NBA's best record, but the Wolves were beaten a total of eight times by the league's bottom eight teams that all won fewer than 29 games. Win just two of those, and they're in third place in the West with a much more favorable matchup for the playoffs. With Butler the resident alpha male in the locker room, the Wolves can no longer be considered an up-and-coming atmosphere where patience with the development of young cornerstones Towns and Andrew Wiggins will be welcomed. With the presence of Butler and the other acquisitions from last year, Taj Gibson, Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, there's clearly a win-now window in place. ""They've learned what it takes to get yourself to the playoffs,"" Butler said. ""Now us as a whole, we have to figure out what it takes to win, whenever we get there. No matter what seed we are, that's what we're expected to do."" Layden wondered aloud whether the Wolves should have been more aggressive to acquire a new player at the trade deadline in February. ""We had a lot of things that went back and forth, and maybe we should've done something a little different,"" Layden said. ""I take responsibility for that, but we're always looking to push and push and get better."" BUTLER'S HEALTH Thibodeau has always leaned heavily on the starters he trusts the most, and this season with the Wolves was no exception. Butler was third in the NBA with an average of 36.7 minutes played per game, and coincidentally or not he missed 23 games, all but two because of trouble with his right knee. Thibodeau said Butler will not need an additional procedure. Butler can also opt out of his contract after next season, without an extension in place. ""It's important for him to feel good about everything that we're doing here,"" Thibodeau said. LONG RANGE The Wolves actually led the NBA during the playoffs with a 41.3 percent make rate from 3-point range, but part of the problem is a lack of space in the playbook for setting up attempts from beyond the arc. They finished last in the league in the regular season with an average of eight 3-pointers made per game. ""I thought our guys in the second half of the season were doing a very good job of looking for opportunities, but we do have to take more,"" Thibodeau said. Even owner Glen Taylor, in an interview earlier this month with his hometown newspaper, the Mankato Free Press, openly questioned the lack of improvement. ""If other teams can learn to shoot 3s, why can't we?"" Taylor told the Free Press. WINNING WITH WIGGINS? The maximum contract the Wolves gave Wiggins last summer will kick in next season, paying the 23-year-old more than $25 million. There's no player on the roster who will be under more pressure to be more consistently productive on both ends of the court. ""The experience of the playoffs was huge for him. He did a lot of good things,"" Thibodeau said. ""I think we saw down the stretch him playing a more complete game, and I think he can build off that."" BJELICA Nemanja Bjelica, who played both forward spots off the bench and was a relatively productive starter during Butler's absence, will be a restricted free agent. His playing time was scant during the playoff series, which Thibodeau said was matchup-related. ""But I thought overall he played really well for us,"" Thibodeau said. ""Sometimes you have to put the team first."" ___ For more AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Jonathan Martin WASHINGTON — For decades, James B. Comey cultivated an image of purity as a lawman who stood above politics and politicians. Then came the book tour. With the release of his memoir this week and a set of high-profile media interviews to publicize it, Mr. Comey — whose firing by President Trump made him a hero to the president’s critics — has veered onto risky terrain, shedding the trappings of a high-minded referee and looking instead like a combatant in the country’s partisan battles. Mr. Comey’s description of the president as an unethical liar “morally unfit” for office; his call for voters to decide Mr. Trump’s fate at the ballot box in 2020; and even his observations about Mr. Trump’s appearance — his “orange” skin, his too-long ties, his hands — are stark departures from the law-enforcement mission of his old agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The personal potshots in particular have surprised some former colleagues who thought of Mr. Comey as relatively sober and serious. Observers on both the left and right — including many who count themselves as fierce critics of Mr. Trump’s — say that in embarking on his star turn, Mr. Comey may be undercutting his own indictment of the president’s character and conduct. “The real impact of having the former head of the F.B.I. calling the president unfit is dependent on the just-the-facts professional image of the F.B.I.,” said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who has been critical of Mr. Trump. “To the extent that the former director appears petty and anything less than high-minded, it diminishes the impact of his critique.” “In a time when almost every public debate is defined by people lining up with their respective tribes,” Mr. Steel added, “he’s managed to alienate both.” Mr. Comey, in remarks promoting the book, says he is trying to rouse the country to see Mr. Trump through the lens of “ethical leadership,” arguing that the president “does not reflect the values” of Democrats, Republicans or independents. Asked on ABC if Mr. Trump should be impeached, Mr. Comey said he hoped it would not happen because voters were “duty bound” to “go to the voting booth and vote their values.” Mr. Comey has cast himself as a truth-teller before, sometimes to the irritation of colleagues or superiors. He threatened to quit his job at the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration rather than sign off on a domestic surveillance program the White House demanded, and he refused Mr. Trump’s entreaties to back off of the investigation of Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey a few months later, calling him a “grandstander” and citing the F.B.I.’s investigation into his administration’s ties to Russia. “After he was fired, he finally became the martyr he always held himself out to be,” said Matthew A. Miller, who served as a top Justice Department official under President Obama when Mr. Comey led the F.B.I. “By doing a tour like this where you kind of get down in the gutter the way he has, you sacrifice your claim on being a martyr.” Even before the release of his book, “A Higher Loyalty,” the White House, working in concert with the Republican National Committee, began an all-out campaign to besmirch “Lyin’ Comey” — the name of a website the party created to make the case — as dishonest, self-serving and driven by partisanship. But with his one-liners and cutting asides about the president, Mr. Comey only appeared to play into the hands of allies of Mr. Trump, who are eager to paint the former F.B.I. director as just another figure working for the president’s defeat. And Mr. Comey has drawn bipartisan criticism with his latest efforts to explain — and, to some degree, recast — his much-criticized handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic pollster, said Mr. Comey’s standing had been undermined by the one-two punch of liberal attacks over his role in the 2016 election and the more recent assault led by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies. “Trump has tried to define him as a bad operator, and the problem for Comey is that you can quote a lot of Democrats saying the same,” Mr. Mellman said. At this point, it seems unlikely that Mr. Comey’s book or his performance in interviews to promote it will sway public opinion in a country that is already intensely polarized along partisan lines. Mr. Trump’s approval ratings have been similar for months, and the roughly 40 percent of Americans who support him have proven remarkably unshakable, while the 56 percent who disapprove will probably not change their views on Mr. Comey's account. While Mr. Comey is sure to captivate the public for a few days with his biting descriptions of the president and dramatic of interactions with him, the combination of the supercharged news cycle and the looming — and far more consequential — investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel probing Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, is sure to eventually overshadow his memoir. “It keeps the story of cover-ups and corruption on the public radar while Mueller is doing his investigation, but Comey is just a pit stop along the way of that,” said Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic strategist. “Much to Comey’s chagrin, his moment has passed. There’s nothing in this book we don’t already know. He just adds one more hole to a ship that’s already sinking.” Mr. Comey plainly considers himself to be a figure who is above the political fray, driven and guided solely by facts. His friends and advisers say he wants the book to stir a conversation about the value of honesty. “Telling the truth should not be seen as a political act,” said Keith Urbahn, Mr. Comey’s book agent. “It should just be the truth.” Yet there is a twist: While he professes to be uneasy with the country’s growing polarization and appears to disdain partisanship, Mr. Comey has in effect weaponized himself against a Republican president by calling for him to be voted out of office. Mr. Comey may not want to be used as anybody’s “political battering ram,” as one associate put it, but he recognizes that is precisely how his book will be deployed. Friends say Mr. Comey expected his memoir would be criticized because of how it would inevitably be construed: either as airbrushing history and not being honest about Mr. Trump’s transgressions, or as a self-serving and score-settling account with the man who ended his career in law enforcement. Still, Mr. Comey’s former colleagues rejected any notion that he has transformed himself into a political actor or hurt his reputation. “Jim Comey is as upright, honest and decent a person and public servant as I have ever met,” said Jack Goldsmith, who served with him in the Bush Justice Department. As for his willingness to engage in Trumpian insults, invoking the size of the president’s hands, his allies argue that he is simply attempting to paint vivid scenes and does the same with the other presidents he served. Mr. Miller, however, said Mr. Comey tends to be “at his best when he’s coloring inside the lines and following the rules,” as prosecutors are trained to do. “What you see in the book is not just a factual recitation, but also a lot of spin on the ball,” he said.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael S. Schmidt WASHINGTON — Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump’s former chief strategist, was subpoenaed last week by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to testify before a grand jury as part of the investigation into possible links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The move marked the first time Mr. Mueller is known to have used a grand jury subpoena to seek information from a member of Mr. Trump’s inner circle. The special counsel’s office has used subpoenas before to seek information on Mr. Trump’s associates and their possible ties to Russia or other foreign governments. A second subpoena for Mr. Bannon to testify came from a House panel on Tuesday. The Mueller subpoena could be a negotiating tactic. Mr. Mueller is likely to allow Mr. Bannon to forgo the grand jury appearance if he agrees to instead be questioned by investigators in the less formal setting of the special counsel’s offices about ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia and about the president’s conduct in office, according to the person, who would not be named discussing the case. But it was not clear why Mr. Mueller treated Mr. Bannon differently from the dozen administration officials who were interviewed in the final months of last year and were never served with a subpoena. The subpoena is a sign that Mr. Bannon is not personally the focus of the inquiry. Justice Department rules allow prosecutors to subpoena the targets of investigations only in rare circumstances. On Tuesday, he was questioned for 10 hours behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a Russian election meddling investigation. The meeting turned contentious as Mr. Bannon repeatedly said he could not answer questions, citing executive privilege. The committee eventually subpoenaed Mr. Bannon to compel him to provide answers. After the interview, Democrats on the committee accused the White House of exerting influence over Mr. Bannon to keep him from expounding about his time in the West Wing. A senior administration official insisted that the White House had not told Mr. Bannon to exert executive privilege. Mr. Bannon did not address reporters, and a spokesman for Mr. Mueller did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Mueller issued the subpoena after Mr. Bannon was quoted in a new book criticizing Mr. Trump, saying that Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with Russians was “treasonous” and predicting that the special counsel investigation would ultimately center on money laundering. After excerpts from the book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” were published this month, Mr. Trump derided Mr. Bannon publicly and threatened to sue him for defamation. Mr. Bannon was soon ousted as the executive chairman of the hard-right website Breitbart News. Some legal experts said the subpoena could be a sign that the investigation was intensifying, while others said it might simply be a negotiating tactic to persuade Mr. Bannon to cooperate with the investigation. The experts also said it could be a signal to Mr. Bannon, who has tried to publicly patch up his falling-out with the president, that despite Mr. Trump’s legal threats, Mr. Bannon must be completely forthcoming with investigators. Prosecutors generally prefer to interview witnesses before a grand jury when they believe they have information that the witnesses do not know, or when they think they might catch the witnesses in a lie. It is much easier for a witness to stop the questioning or sidestep questions in an interview than during grand jury testimony, which is transcribed, and witnesses are required to answer every question. “By forcing someone to testify through a subpoena, you are providing the witness with cover because they can say, ‘I had no choice — I had to go in and testify about everything I knew,’” said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a prosecutor for the independent counsel that investigated Bill Clinton when he was president. Significant grand jury activity may undermine the case that White House officials have made for months: that they believe the inquiry is coming to an end and are convinced that the president will be cleared. Mr. Mueller has told Mr. Trump’s lawyers that he will probably want to question the president before the investigation concludes, but no interview has been scheduled. Mr. Bannon has limited firsthand knowledge about two key issues within Mr. Mueller’s purview — the president’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, a decision made without Mr. Bannon present, and the drafting of a misleading statement about the subject of the June 2016 meeting with Russians, in which they promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But even Mr. Bannon’s secondhand knowledge could be used to draw a contrast with statements from people with firsthand knowledge whom Mr. Mueller has already interviewed. And Mr. Bannon was directly involved in a number of other major moments, including the decision-making around the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, who was dismissed after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. Mr. Bannon also helped run the transition after Chris Christie, now the former governor of New Jersey, was fired as head of that team. And he was the chief executive of the Trump campaign in October 2016 when WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of stolen personal emails from the hacked account of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. In “Fire and Fury,” Mr. Bannon was quoted by the author, Michael Wolff, as suggesting that Donald Trump Jr.; the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner; and Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman at the time, were “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” for attending the meeting with Russians at Trump Tower. Mr. Bannon said he believed there was “zero” chance that the younger Mr. Trump did not take them to meet his father, who has said he knew nothing about the meeting. “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers,” Mr. Bannon said in the book. Mr. Trump erupted in anger after the excerpts were published, calling Mr. Bannon “Sloppy Steve” on Twitter and saying he had “cried when he got fired and begged for his job.” “Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Too bad!” Days after the excerpts were published, a statement was issued in Mr. Bannon’s name in which he tried to back away from his assertions in the book. He said that his reference to treason was aimed at Mr. Manafort, not the president’s son. Mr. Bannon did not apologize, however, and though he had approved the statement, an associate sent it to reporters without his knowledge. The president appeared to ease his anger toward Mr. Bannon at the end of last week. When asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal whether his break with Mr. Bannon was “permanent,” the president replied, “I don’t know what the word ‘permanent’ means.” People close to Mr. Bannon took the president’s comments as a signal that Mr. Trump was aware that his fired strategist would soon be contacted by investigators. Mr. Trump has a history of reaching out to people he has fired, including those under investigation, directly or indirectly, as he did with Mr. Flynn after he was dismissed and before he struck a plea deal with Mr. Mueller’s investigators. Mr. Bannon has hired William A. Burck of the Washington office of the Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan law firm to represent him in the defamation threats from Mr. Trump and the congressional inquiries. Mr. Burck also represents several current and former administration officials who have been interviewed as witnesses by Mr. Mueller’s investigators. Among them are the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, and the former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Matt Apuzzo and Ali Watkins contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press Trainer Bob Baffert is feeling pretty good about the chances of his latest Kentucky Derby contender, Justify, despite the horse's lack of experience on the track. Baffert told ""PodcastOne Sports Now"" co-hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg that Justify — the early favorite for Saturday's race — should be fine despite having only run three races in his life. Baffert said Justify has shown an ability to adjust quickly to race conditions, and he expects that to continue in the Derby. Baffert is seeking his fifth Derby win with Justify, which won the Santa Anita Derby last month. The horse will be trying to become the first to win the Kentucky Derby after not racing as a 2-year-old since Apollo turned the trick in 1882. One thing Baffert doesn't want to see during Derby week, though, is an animal of another kind. Baffert says he has a thing about black cats, and hopes one doesn't cross his path in Louisville. AP basketball writer Brian Mahoney joins the hosts to talk about NBA playoffs, and Dahlberg discusses the Vegas Golden Knights and the scene in Las Vegas for the NHL playoffs.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies have decided to make J.B. Bickerstaff their next head coach, removing the interim tag from his title. The Grizzlies did not disclose terms Tuesday of Bickerstaff's new deal. He will be introduced at a news conference Wednesday. Bickerstaff was the associate head coach when Memphis fired David Fizdale in late November of his second season. Guard Mike Conley had season-ending surgery to repair his left heel and Achilles tendon, and the Grizzlies finished the season at 22-60 for the second-worst record in the NBA behind only Phoenix. They had to win their regular season home finale to avoid the worst record since relocating to Memphis for the 2001-02 season. But they should wind up with their highest draft pick since 2009. ""J.B. did an admirable job as interim head coach last season in what was a challenging set of circumstances,"" general manager Chris Wallace said in a statement. ""J.B. has connected with our players and earned their respect throughout his time in Memphis, and we have been pleased with his role in developing our young players. We are excited to see him coach with a full offseason and a healthy roster next season."" This will be the first time Bickerstaff has been hired as head coach without an interim tag. He finished the 2015-16 season as the interim coach in Houston after Kevin McHale was fired, and he went 37-34 with the Rockets. Bickerstaff said at the end of the season that he had been discussing his future with management and wanted to return. ""I feel like we have started something,"" he said. ""We have started to build a culture. You want to be part of a group that you like. I think there's going to be a tremendous bump next year, health permitting. I would love to be a part of it."" Conley is expected back healthy, and the Grizzlies still have center Marc Gasol with a handful of young players like Dillon Brooks who got plenty of playing time under Bickerstaff. Bickerstaff also was an assistant coach with Minnesota between 2007 and 2011 and worked for his father, Bernie, with the Charlotte Bobcats between 2004 and 2007. He was director of operations for the University of Minnesota men's basketball team after playing two seasons. He started his college career at Oregon State. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press MILWAUKEE — Giannis Antetokounmpo is trying to eliminate the drama around whether Jabari Parker will return to the Milwaukee Bucks. It doesn't sound like he wants Parker to leave as a restricted free agent. ""Jabari ain't going nowhere,"" Antetokounmpo said with a smile. ""He's going to be here and he's going to be ready for the next season."" It's just one of two big decisions facing the Bucks this offseason. They might be hiring a new coach, too. The organization has arrived at a crossroads. A new arena is opening in the fall, while Antetokounmpo is a budding NBA superstar because of the athleticism that earned him his ""Greek Freak"" nickname. However they proceed, the Bucks have grown beyond being a feel-good story. They've established a baseline of success with the Antetokounmpo-led group, having gone to the playoffs three times in the last four years. The next step is to get beyond the first round for the first time since going to the Eastern Conference finals in 2001. The best way to do that is to play more consistently in the regular season in order to secure a top-four seed and home-court advantage in the first round. The Bucks were eliminated on Saturday night by the Boston Celtics in seven games, with all four losses coming on the road. ""Clinching the playoffs, going to Game 7, somewhat of an accomplishment. Not really what we set out to do,"" guard Malcolm Brogdon said Sunday as players had exit interviews with coach Joe Prunty at the team's downtown training facility and packed up for the offseason. Whether Prunty is back when the Bucks reconvene for training camp remains in question. The veteran assistant was promoted to replace the fired Jason Kidd in late January. General manager Jon Horst said at the time that the team would conduct a search after the season and that Prunty would be a candidate. That's still the case, Prunty said, although the team has not detailed when it will conduct interviews. ""To be honest with you, I think at this stage we all thought we would still be playing and were hoping that we would be playing,"" Prunty said. Milwaukee was 21-16 under Prunty in the regular season after starting 23-22 with Kidd. Getting to Game 7 in the first round was a small measure of progress after Milwaukee was eliminated in six games the previous season by Toronto. But issues that plagued the Bucks during the regular season contributed to their demise against the Celtics. Milwaukee finished last in the NBA in rebounding (39.8 per game) and 25th in opponent 3-point shooting (37 percent). The Bucks excelled on the break and were sixth in the league in 2-point shooting (53 percent) but 22nd from 3-point range (35 percent). A full year with Parker might help. He averaged 12.6 points in 31 games after returning in February from the second left knee injury of his four-year career. Antetokounmpo thinks his teammate's return is a done deal. ""And we are going to be all excited, playing in a new arena and everyone is going to be having fun,"" he said. Other notes and highlights as the offseason begins: COOL KHRIS Khris Middleton can get overshadowed sometimes by the high-flying Antetokounmpo. But the sixth-year forward is making a name for himself with his all-around game. After scoring a career-high 20.1 points per game in the regular season, Middleton averaged 24.7 in the playoffs. He's also capable of guarding every position but center. THUMBS UP? Eric Bledsoe played the last three games of the series with a wrap protecting his left thumb. The right-handed Bledsoe said Sunday that he hoped to avoid surgery, but that he might have to wear a brace for a couple months. JET PACKED Veteran guard Jason Terry wants to return to Milwaukee for his 20th NBA season. The NBA's active career leader in 3-point field goals will be 41 when the next season tips off in October. Averaging 16 minutes a game, Terry's most important role was to bring energy off the bench. He's also a respected voice in the locker room. ""Obviously I know my impact. I've been here two years now. I want to see the process, the finished product, because I know the potential,"" Terry said. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press BOSTON — The Boston Celtics have been mining possibility out of improbable odds throughout the 2017-2018 season. A season filled with so much promise was jolted just five minutes into their season opener back in October when Gordon Hayward was lost for the year to a fractured ankle. It looked to be derailed for sure when Marcus Smart suffered a torn ligament in his thumb in March, followed by Kyrie Irving being sidelined for the season a month later following a pair of knee surgeries. Yet, after completing a 4-1 series win with their 114-112 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night, the Celtics are somehow back where no one — except maybe only them — believed they could be: headed to a second straight Eastern Conference final. A rematch with Cleveland Cavaliers and LeBron James awaits them, but for a Celtics team that has had to trudge uphill throughout the season, still playing at this point of the postseason feels like reason to celebrate. Coach Brad Stevens said this group has never stopped playing together despite all the challenges they've faced. It's a testament to a program they've been nurturing since he took over as coach five years ago. ""I always hoped we would get to a point where if things don't go our way, we're still extremely competitive because we have a kind of foundation in place,"" he said. ""Things haven't always gone our way, but these guys are really talented, they're really tough, they fit Boston. And hopefully we keep playing well."" According to Elias Sports Bureau, the Celtics are the first team in NBA history to reach the conference finals in back-to-back seasons, while returning only four players from one year to the next (Smart, Jaylen Brown, Al Horford and Terry Rozier). That are advancing to the Eastern Conference finals in consecutive seasons for the first time since doing so five straight times from 1984 to 1988. Brown was reinserted back into the starting lineup Wednesday for the first time since he injured his right hamstring last round in Boston's Game 7 win over Milwaukee. He made the most of it, combining with rookie Jayson Tatum to score 49 points on 18 of 28 shooting. Brown said he was treating Wednesday's game like another Game 7. ""We didn't want to go back to Philly,"" he said. ""We didn't want to keep building their momentum and it was good to get a close out game here on our home floor."" Tatum, who had the go-ahead layup in the closing seconds Wednesday, has helped fortify that quartet over the latter half of the season. Like Brown, he has become one of the go-to players on a reconfigured Celtics roster that in many ways is now being led by his youthful core. He made his NBA debut against the Cavs back in October. He said he feels like a completely different player as he prepares to face them again. ""It's like night and day,"" he said. ""I remember the first time we played them I was so nervous. But it's been 90 games since then. We've been through a lot. I'm a lot more relaxed and calm, but ready to go out there and play."" PLAYOFF AL While the young players on Boston's rosters have been huge in Boston's success, Brown said the veteran leadership of Horford has been just as important in helping hold things together throughout the season. Despite being surrounded by a group of 20-somethings, the 32-year-old ""Playoff Al"" has helped them all play well beyond their years. But it hasn't just been talk. With 15 points and eight rebounds in Game 5, Horford has now scored in double figures in each of Boston's 12 games this postseason, including five double-doubles. ""We lean on our best, we lean on Al during those tough stretches, and he came up big for us,"" Brown said. SUPER ROOKIE In five games this series, Tatum averaged 23.6 points while shooting 52.4 percent from the field. His scoring average is the second-highest by Boston rookie in a single playoff series. It trails only Tom Heinsohn, who averaged 24 points per game in 1957. INJURY UPDATE Tatum said he jammed his left thumb late in the game, but said it is OK. ... Reserve G Shane Larkin (left shoulder sprain), who sat out Wednesday's game, told reporters that an MRI revealed some issues. But he is going to work toward returning sometime against Cleveland. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball ___ Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press The unthinkable has happened before. Conference semifinals, 2010, Boston vs. Philadelphia: Boston wins the first two games at home, then goes into Philadelphia to capture Game 3 and take a commanding 3-0 series lead. Undeterred, Philadelphia won in seven games to reach the Eastern Conference finals. One small detail to note: That was in hockey. If there's one piece of solace for the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors right now, it's likely this — comebacks from 3-0 deficits are not completely unheard of in major sports. There's been four of them in the NHL. Another happened in baseball, the Boston Red Sox rallying to oust the New York Yankees in the 2004 AL Championship Series. And even Cleveland has blown a 3-0 lead, albeit again in hockey, and that was of the minor league variety in 1960. But in the NBA, never. NBA teams staring into the 0-3 abyss have never been saved: 129 have tried, 129 have failed. On Monday, the 76ers and the Raptors — both down 3-0 after down-to-the-wire defeats in their respective Game 3s of their Eastern Conference semifinal series — get their chance to be the ones who rewrite that ignominious piece of basketball history. Philadelphia plays host to Boston and Toronto is at Cleveland, with the 76ers and Raptors both trying to find ways to extend their seasons. ""There's a breaking point we all have,"" Philadelphia coach Brett Brown said. ""And I believe that if we can maintain our spirit, why couldn't we be the one? And I mean that. That's my goal with us, is to fight. That's all I know. I can't see any other way to approach this that makes sense to me. So that's what we're going to do."" The odds are obviously overwhelmingly in favor of the Celtics and Cavaliers, who seem destined to meet in the Eastern Conference finals for the second consecutive year. That's hard to believe, given where those clubs were a week or so ago. Both needed to survive Game 7s just to get out of the first round. The narrative around the Celtics, with no Kyrie Irving for the postseason, was that they would be the East high seed ripe for a playoff upset. Oops. They've been unflappable. ""I've never been around a group of guys, and I've been around some really special ones, that can just turn the page and they just play the next play the right way,"" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. ""It's a really unique group in that regard."" The narrative around the Cavaliers was that LeBron James was being asked to do too much and his supporting cast was capable of too little. Oops, again. And now James is five wins from an eighth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals. ""We're getting better,"" Cavs forward Jeff Green said. ""We're getting better each game. Our defense is getting better. We're playing together. Things are turning a corner for us at the right time."" A look at Monday's games: CELTICS AT 76ERS Celtics lead 3-0. Game 4, 6 p.m. EDT, TNT. NEED TO KNOW: The Celtics are playing for a lot of rest. A win on Monday, and the Celtics wouldn't play again until at least Sunday. And there's nothing more valuable than days off to heal nagging things at this time of year. KEEP AN EYE ON: Jayson Tatum. Boston's young standout was brilliant in Game 3 with 24 points, and the Celtics were plus-24 when he was on the floor. In the 11 1/2 minutes he was on the bench, Philadelphia outscored Boston 39-18. STAT QUIRK: Philadelphia set an NBA record with a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season. The 76ers topped the 15-game end-of-season run by the 1950 Rochester Royals — who exited the playoffs in a sweep. PRESSURE IS ON: Ben Simmons. The 76ers point guard made some atrocious decisions in the final moments of Game 3, like going back up with an offensive rebound late in regulation (instead of burning some clock with Philly leading) and the lazy-looking one-handed inbounds pass for a turnover in overtime that sealed Boston's win. RAPTORS AT CAVALIERS Cavaliers lead 3-0. Game 4, 8:30 p.m. EDT, TNT NEED TO KNOW: Pity the Raptors. After coming into these playoffs with title hopes, Toronto has again been unable to solve LeBron James. In the last 15 matchups where the Raptors have faced James, they're 1-14 and are now on the brink of being ousted by the Cavs for the third straight season. KEEP ANY EYE ON: Kevin Love's resurgence. Cleveland's other All-Star has been revived in this series, a development that bodes well for the Cavs going forward. Love finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds in Game 3, responding to urging from Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to play faster. PRESSURE IS ON: Raptors coach Dwane Casey. His moves have been questioned throughout the first three games. Toronto ran a mind-boggling inbounds play in the final minute of Game 3 with guard Fred VanVleet hoisting and missing a 35-foot jumper before the shot clock expired. Casey also benched All-Star DeMar DeRozan for the entire fourth quarter, a bold decision given that he's the club's best offensive player. PRODUCT PLACEMENT: James' choice to wear a Seagram's 7 whiskey cap to his postgame news conference was interesting. Some suspected he might be trolling the Raptors since Seagram's was originally a Canadian company. The logo also includes a small crown, so there's the royal angle. Whatever the case, he may want to start getting Samuel Adams hats ready for the East finals — if he wants to tweak Boston fans a bit more. ___ AP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By John Branch The confetti had hardly stopped falling before the speculation began about the next big move of the Golden State Warriors: Would they visit President Trump at the White House? Coach Steve Kerr has been a vocal critic of the president, calling him “a blowhard,” and plenty of other N.B.A. players have expressed doubt as to whether they would attend a White House ceremony with Trump in office. Soon after the Warriors clinched the N.B.A. championship with a Game 5 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Oakland, Calif., on Monday night, unattributed reports surfaced on Twitter saying that the team had decided it would not go. On Tuesday, the team said that no decisions had been made. “We have not been invited to the White House,” Raymond Ridder, a team spokesman, said in an email. “Today is all about celebrating our championship. We will make those decisions when and if necessary.” Championship teams visiting the White House for a quick ceremony and plenty of photographs is a tradition that stretches back decades. For N.B.A. teams, White House visits rarely happen immediately, but usually occur during the next season when the schedule takes them to Washington, or close to it. After the Warriors won the title in June 2015, they were honored at the White House in February 2016. The Cavaliers, last year’s champions, visited President Barack Obama in November, during a road trip to play the Washington Wizards, two days after the election of Trump. There was already a sense that future visits would be fraught with political anxiety. “Words cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow,” the Cleveland player Richard Jefferson wrote on Snapchat. His teammate LeBron James publicly supported Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. When the New England Patriots visited the White House in April, 34 players attended, according to the team. Two years earlier, when Obama was president, about 50 players made the visit, the Patriots said. The Clemson football team was honored at the White House on Monday for its national championship in January. Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, anticipated the possibility of White House boycotts shortly after the election. “To me, if a player were to choose not to go to the White House, whether they were choosing not to go to the current White House or a future White House, my response would be: That’s a lost opportunity,” Silver told The Undefeated. “Because that’s an opportunity that most citizens who have a political point of view would kill for — the opportunity to directly tell the president of the United States how they feel about an issue.” For the Warriors, the decision to attend a White House ceremony, presuming the invitation comes, would appear to be most complex for Kerr. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was president of the American University of Beirut when he was assassinated outside his office in 1984. A group calling itself Islamic Holy War claimed responsibility later that day. Courts later found that Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah was behind the killing. Kerr has been critical of American foreign policy in the Middle East, and he called Trump’s proposed travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries “a horrible idea.” “We’re really going against the principles of what our country’s about,” Kerr told reporters in January. “And creating fear, it’s the wrong way to go about it.” Kerr, much like his mentor Gregg Popovich, coach of the San Antonio Spurs, has become a strong voice on social and political issues, especially over the past two years. Kerr used the opportunity to thank Obama for pushing for tighter gun control regulations. Trump has been the target of some of his toughest criticism. “The modern coach has to be much more communicative, flexible, aware, conscientious, all those things,” Kerr told Sports Illustrated this spring. “Frankly, I think it’s why Trump couldn’t be more ill-suited to be president, because he’s a blowhard.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Scott Cacciola and Jonah Engel Bromwich OAKLAND, Calif. — As he has grown older, and as he has established himself as one of the great athletes in American history, LeBron James has become increasingly willing to address social and political issues. He has, for instance, denounced police killings of African-American men, and he took sides in the 2016 presidential campaign, endorsing Hillary Clinton and making a public appearance on her behalf. The pointed and difficult topics that often grip this country have become familiar terrain for James. But on the eve of his seventh straight trip to the N.B.A. finals, James was, by his own admission, distracted and upset, his mind wandering from the supreme challenge that he and the Cleveland Cavaliers again face in taking on the Golden State Warriors with everything at stake. The series begins on Thursday night, but on Wednesday afternoon, as James addressed a group of reporters on hand to cover Game 1, he said that all he wanted at that moment was to be with his children. “This is kind of killing me inside right now,” he said. The “this” James was referring to was that he was not at home to comfort his children over the racial slur that, the police said Wednesday, was painted on the front gates of a Los Angeles-area home that James owns. Several hours after the episode was disclosed, James discussed it at what became a frank and emotional news conference in Oakland at Oracle Arena, the home of the Warriors. James said the vandalism illustrated the difficulties black people faced in America. “No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is — it’s tough,” James said. “And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African-Americans until we feel equal in America.” Officer Norma Eisenman, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that the act of vandalism at James’s home was being investigated as a hate crime and that the slur had been painted over by the property’s managers. The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported that James’s wife and three children were at the family’s home in Bath Township, Ohio, at the time of the episode. “My family is safe,” James said, adding: “Obviously, you see I’m not my normal energetic self. It will pass. That’s fine. I’m figuring it out. I’m thinking about my kids a lot.” If nothing else, James said, he saw the episode as another opportunity to address an issue that is important to him. “If this incident that happened to me and my family today can keep the conversation going and can shed light on us trying to figure out a way to keep progressing and not regressing, then I’m not against it happening to us again,” he said. “I mean, it’s as long as my family is safe.” Over the last several seasons, James has used his platform as the league’s most visible superstar to voice opinions on matters that do not necessarily involve what he does on the court. His increasing willingness to speak his mind has set him apart from stars of previous eras, including Michael Jordan, to whom he is often compared as a player. James, a four-time N.B.A. most valuable player, won the league’s annual J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award last month in connection with his efforts to improve educational opportunities in his hometown, Akron, Ohio. On the court, of course, James remains as fearsome as ever. Through the first three rounds of this year’s playoffs, he averaged 32.5 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists per game while shooting 56.6 percent from the field. Now he confronts the Warriors, again, after losing to them in the finals in 2015 and then stunning them last year to give the Cavaliers their first N.B.A. title. “I will be as focused as I can be on the job at hand tomorrow,” James said Wednesday. “But this is a situation where it just puts me back in place of what’s actually more important, and basketball’s not the most important thing in my life.” The appearance of the slur on James’s home, in West Los Angeles, was reported at 6:44 a.m. Wednesday, said Officer Aereon Jefferson, a spokesman for the Police Department. He said it had been painted over by the property’s managers by the time that officers arrived a short while later. Jefferson said that the episode was still being investigated and that the police did not know who first reported the slur. At one point during Wednesday’s news conference, James said that when he learned of the slur, he thought about the mother of Emmett Till. After her 14-year-old son was lynched in 1955, she insisted there be an open coffin so people could see for themselves the brutality of the murder. “She wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America,” James said. So on a day when James might normally have been talking about the star players he will be battling on the Warriors, he was instead citing one of the more infamous moments in American history. However familiar Thursday night will be when the Warriors and the Cavaliers finally play Game 1, and James takes on Stephen Curry and Company, Wednesday ended up having a far different feel.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press NEW YORK — The more Knicks management asked about David Fizdale, the more they heard how much players respect him. It can't hurt that one of them is LeBron James. And while Knicks fans can dream of Fizdale's relationship with James giving them a shot when the superstar enters free agency as expected, a team building from the bottom can't focus on one player — even the best one in the game. New York needed a coach that can bring out the best in everyone on the roster, and that's what the Knicks believe they have in Fizdale. The Knicks agreed to a deal with the former Memphis Grizzlies coach last week and introduced him Tuesday at a news conference at Madison Square Garden. ""I think the big thing that we found — and that's obviously terrific that some of the game's greats recognized David for who he is as a man and as a coach — but the players that are not that, just the guys 1 through 15, the reviews coming back on him were all very consistently similar,"" general manager Scott Perry said. ""That he invested in us, that he's going to develop you, he's going to challenge you, he's going to hold you accountable. And so I think that's the important thing, that David has shown the ability to relate to a number of players across the board, not just the star players."" Still, Fizdale's relationship with James gives New Yorkers a slither of hope. Though that hope is based more in fantasy than reality. While James could become a free agent this summer, the Knicks would be unlikely to afford him and even less likely to impress him, given the long climb they face to contention. They have missed the playoffs five straight seasons and will be without All-Star Kristaps Porzingis when the Fizdale era begins as he recovers from a torn left knee ligament. Fizdale said he is only focused for now on who will be playing for him. ""I can't really speak on free agency,"" Fizdale said. ""I just know that if we build this thing right together with the guys we have here, who I'm focused on here, people will want to come."" Fizdale wanted to come, despite how quickly coaches get eaten up in New York. Perry and team president Steve Mills interviewed 10 other candidates during their search, and also spoke with players and executives from around the league to gain information about the men they were considering as the replacement for Jeff Hornacek. One of them was Pat Riley, Fizdale's boss in Miami when the Heat won two NBA titles while he was an assistant to Erik Spoelstra. Riley had kept in contact with Fizdale after he was fired early last season in Memphis after clashing with star center Marc Gasol. ""No one was more happy when he got the news ... to see one of his guys be here, coming back and doing this and taking this challenge,"" Fizdale said. ""I'm sure right now he's pretty proud."" Even the failure with Gasol after the Grizzlies had gone to the playoffs in Fizdale's first season impressed the Knicks during their discussions. Fizdale didn't hide from his share of the responsibility, acknowledging that maybe he pushed too hard on a team whose window to contend for a title he believed was shrinking. ""When someone owns an issue like that, we all hit adversity, but it's how you deal with it and how you learn from it,"" Mills said, ""and that's one of the things that really impressed us about David."" Fizdale had spent eight seasons before going to Memphis in Miami, where the Heat reached four straight NBA Finals. Fizdale said his relationship with their stars developed by spending time with them, talking honestly about important things like family matters, and of course by winning championships. The last one will be difficult in New York. He is the 11th Knicks coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. Fizdale said he couldn't pass up the chance to coach at Madison Square Garden, even though he was a candidate for jobs where there is more stability. ""The risk/reward thing was, I just said to hell with it,"" Fizdale said. ""It's the Knicks, what are we talking about here?""

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Mark Landler and Noah Weiland WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani, reeling after a chaotic first week as President Trump’s lawyer, tried again on Sunday to straighten out his client’s story. But Mr. Giuliani raised new questions about whether Mr. Trump had paid hush money to other women and suggested the president might invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying in the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor hired by Mr. Trump to smooth communication between the White House and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, instead painted Mr. Mueller as an out-of-control prosecutor bent on trapping Mr. Trump into committing perjury. The president, he said, could defy a subpoena to testify. “We don’t have to,” Mr. Giuliani said in a rambling, 22-minute interview on ABC’s “This Week” program. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” Mr. Giuliani, who met with the special counsel’s office shortly after joining the legal team last month, said he and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, agreed that the president should not speak to Mr. Mueller. But he acknowledged that he had little, if any, control over the president, who said as recently as Friday that he still wanted to speak to the special counsel. “How can I ever be confident of that?” Mr. Giuliani said, when asked whether Mr. Trump would not invoke his right to avoid self-incrimination. “I’m facing a situation with the president and all the other lawyers are, in which every lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify, I’ve got a client who wants to testify.” It was one of several startling admissions by Mr. Giuliani, during his first extended television appearance since Mr. Trump criticized him last week as not having his “facts straight” about payments made to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford. Mr. Giuliani said it was possible that Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, Michael D. Cohen, had made additional payments to other women on the president’s behalf. “I have no knowledge of that,” Mr. Giuliani said when asked about other payments, “but I would think if it was necessary, yes.” If Mr. Trump were to invoke the Fifth Amendment, he would undercut his longstanding claim that he has nothing to hide about his campaign’s ties to Russia. During the presidential campaign, he ridiculed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, when some of her aides invoked the Fifth Amendment during a congressional investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server. “The mob takes the Fifth,” Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in September 2016. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” After his interview, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump at his golf club in Northern Virginia. Mr. Giuliani told the ABC anchor, George Stephanopoulos, that he was still getting up to speed on Mr. Trump’s legal issues — a fact that became apparent as the interview went on. As was the case during his interviews last week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to speak largely off the cuff. He speculated freely and contradicted himself, sometimes from one statement to the next. He said, for example, that Mr. Mueller would be to blame if Mr. Trump refused to testify because his office had leaked a list of questions that the special counsel would like to ask him. But then he admitted he did not know who leaked the questions, which were reported by The New York Times. Mr. Giuliani referred repeatedly to a federal judge’s criticism of the special counsel’s fraud case against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign. The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said on Friday that the case seemed motivated by a desire to get Mr. Manafort to potentially incriminate Mr. Trump. “There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.” Mr. Giuliani created a furor on Wednesday when he contradicted the president about the payment to Ms. Clifford. Speaking on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Ms. Clifford, to keep her from making public a story about an affair she claims she had with Mr. Trump — a claim that he denies. When asked in April by reporters traveling on Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said he did not. On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he was still trying to establish when Mr. Trump learned that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. But he added that as a legal matter, it did not matter since the payment did not violate federal campaign finance rules. Asked about the discrepancies between his account and the president’s statement, Mr. Giuliani said: “Those don’t amount to anything — what is said to the press. That’s political.” Mr. Giuliani did not shed much new light on the nature of the payments themselves. He said Mr. Cohen “made payments for the president, or he conducted business for president, which means he had legal fees, moneys laid out and expenditures.” But he characterized the sum Ms. Clifford received as a “nuisance” payment. “I never thought $130,000 was a real payment,” Mr. Giuliani said. “People don’t go away for $130,000.” Mr. Giuliani accused Ms. Clifford of trying to make as much money as possible from her notoriety, noting that she made a cameo appearance during the opening skit on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s admission on Wednesday caught Mr. Trump’s staff off guard and prompted Mr. Trump to try to clarify the nature of payments he made to Mr. Cohen. The morning after Mr. Giuliani’s comments, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Cohen “received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.” A day later, he told reporters gathered outside the White House that Mr. Giuliani did not know the particulars of the case, even after Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Wednesday night that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say. “Virtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it’s been said wrong, or it’s been covered wrong by the press,” Mr. Trump said on Friday. “He’ll get his facts straight.” Seeming to chastise Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump added: “You know what? Learn before you speak. It’s a lot easier.” Some of Mr. Trump’s legal and political advisers believe Mr. Giuliani’s comments could put the president in legal jeopardy, since federal officials are required to report liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump’s last disclosure, which he signed last June, does not mention any debt to Mr. Cohen. On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani tried to clarify what Mr. Trump called a “retainer.” “The retainer agreement was to repay expenses, which turns out to have included this one,” Mr. Giuliani said. Appearing after Mr. Giuliani on the same program, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called Mr. Giuliani’s interview an “absolute unmitigated disaster” and “one of the worst TV appearances by any attorney on behalf of a client in modern times.” “He now expects the American people to believe that he doesn’t really know the facts,” Mr. Avenatti added. “I think it is obvious to the American people that this is a cover-up, that they are making it up as they go along.”  video  Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Letters To the Editor: Frank Bruni argues that President Trump’s reluctance to attack Stormy Daniels is an extraordinary, if not unique, aberration for a man who so readily denigrates, bullies, insults and threatens others (“The Calm Before the Stormy,” column, March 21). Rather, as Mr. Bruni observes, he is the “tempered pacifist,” perhaps fearful of what will be publicly revealed. More blatant and infinitely more consequential is his treatment of Vladimir Putin. As reported in “President’s Call to Putin Dodges Talk of Foul Play” (front page, March 21), Mr. Trump made a congratulatory call to Mr. Putin for his lopsided and undemocratic victory while withholding any criticism of Russia for its interference in our political process, its cyberattacks or its alleged role in the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England. We have a right, and a responsibility, to question Mr. Trump’s motivation. Mr. Trump’s treatment of Mr. Putin serves no clear political purpose and, in fact, runs counter to all the advice he has been given by his advisers. A logical speculation — and one can only speculate — is that just as the president may be fearful of what Stormy Daniels may reveal, he fears the same with Mr. Putin. For this reason, Congress should take a clear and proactive step to ensure that the Mueller investigation is not undermined. LARRY S. SANDBERG, NEW YORK Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's vice president of men's basketball, will be making the rounds this month, bouncing from conference meeting to conference meeting, talking with coaches and athletic directors about reforming college hoops. On Tuesday at a posh hotel with a poolside view of the McDowell Mountains in Arizona, Gavitt spent time with the Big 12 and Pac-12. Gavitt also worked in a call with USA Basketball to discuss what to do with the summer youth circuit. A week after Condoleezza Rice presented the Commission on College Basketball's report on how to fix the sport, part of the work that needs to be done is figure out what exactly it all means. ""There's a lot to do to make that happen because the recommendations are really sound, but there's an awful lot of interpretation, I think, that has to go into what exactly the recommendation is and how we put it into practice,"" said Gavitt, the son of the late Dave Gavitt, who helped found the Big East. The Rice Commission made proposals ranging from changing NBA draft rules to hitting NCAA rule-breakers with harsher penalties. Dan Gavitt will lead the reformation of summer recruiting events, with a goal of giving college basketball coaches NCAA-run events where they can connect with high school players outside of the AAU circuit. ""We want to achieve what the recommendations are meant to achieve, but it's a very unorganized and unregulated space, much of which will continue to exist,"" Gavitt said. At the heart of an FBI investigation of college basketball was the convergence of apparel companies, agents, AAU basketball and college coaches. Whether the Rice Commission can remedy the issues that led to the indictments of 10 people, including several assistant coaches, remains to be seen. ""I think those are a very complex issue,"" Gavitt said. ""I hope they help to address that. I think time will tell. There's an awful lot there and some of the things that we might be able to get at very specifically, the root cause of all that, may be out of the purview of what we can do and thus weren't part of the recommendations. But what the recommendations were I think can help and we're committed to making them happen."" The Rice Commission also recommended the NCAA and USA Basketball, with some help from the NBA, establish an evaluation system for youth players to put the best 100 or so on a path to playing for the national team and maybe jumping straight to the pros, while others would be categorized as having pro potential but not necessarily from high school. And still others would be categorized as having Division I scholarship potential. ""We need to figure out if those are the right numbers,"" he said. ""If those are the right levels. How is each level different in terms of how we set up for July? That's the kind of level of detail that we've already started digging into."" Kansas coach Bill Self's program was mentioned in the most recent updated indictment to come from New York prosecutors, though no one related to the program is known to be in trouble with the law and Self has claimed no wrongdoing by Kansas. Self is also a member of the NCAA's basketball oversight committee. He said the oversight committee will play a role in making some of the interpretations Gavitt believes are necessary to turn the recommendations into NCAA legislation. ""What the committee is designed to do is look out for the best interest of the game, and it has been decided that this is in the best interest of the game,"" Self said. ""We will work to try to look into intended consequences and unintended consequences."" The commission recommended increasing penalties for the most severe NCAA violations to five-year postseason bans and lifetime bans for coaches. ""I don't know if I have an opinion on all those things yet,"" Self said. ""In theory, I think they're positive. In theory, but you have to be able to dissect it and get into all those things. I haven't studied it. I've read (the report) like everybody else has. And certainly from what I read, I read more positive than negative."" The NCAA will need cooperation from the NBA, powerful shoe and apparel companies such as Nike and Adidas and player agents to accomplish a good chunk of what the commission recommended. Within what the NCAA controls, there will be a need for consensus building among member schools with a wide-range of priorities. Compromise will likely be needed. But any differences should not be significant enough to stop implementation of the Rice Commission's recommendations, Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said. ""I don't see anything that we have control over,"" Delany said, ""that has an insurmountable political problem associated with it."" Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter Baker and Eileen Sullivan WASHINGTON — President Trump distanced himself from his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, on Thursday, saying that a federal criminal investigation was focused on Mr. Cohen’s business dealings and had nothing to do with his legal representation of the president. The president acknowledged that Mr. Cohen represents him in connection with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has asserted that she had extramarital sexual relations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election as part of what she now calls a “hush agreement.” But Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen did nothing wrong in that matter. Mr. Cohen handled just “a tiny, tiny little fraction” of his legal work, Mr. Trump said. “But Michael would represent me and represent me on some things,” the president said in a telephone call to “Fox & Friends,” his favorite cable television show. “He represents me, like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me.” “From what I see,” he continued, “he did absolutely nothing wrong. There were no campaign funds going into this, which would have been a problem.” “From what I understand, they’re looking at his businesses,” he added. Discussing Mr. Cohen’s decision to decline to testify in a lawsuit by Ms. Clifford, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, Mr. Trump said he was probably just following the advice of his own lawyers. “I’m not involved, and I’ve been told I’m not involved.” The president’s mention of Ms. Clifford was striking because he has mainly shown restraint in not discussing her. And his comments about Mr. Cohen were among his most extensive since the F.B.I. raided the lawyer’s office, apartment and hotel room after obtaining a warrant from a federal court. Mr. Trump complained on Twitter afterward that the raid meant that “attorney-client privilege is dead!” But his remarks on Fox suggested that the investigation did not involve Mr. Cohen’s legal work. “Michael is a businessman, he’s got a business. He also practices law,” Mr. Trump said. “And they’re looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.” Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, seized on the president’s comments, suggesting they would help her lawsuit trying to nullify the 2016 nondisclosure agreement by proving Mr. Trump’s involvement in the effort to keep her quiet before the election. “Thank you @foxandfriends for having Mr. Trump on this morning to discuss Michael Cohen and our case,” he wrote on Twitter. He went on MSNBC and CNN to reinforce his point. “This case gets better every day, every hour, and one of the reasons why it gets better is that they step in to every trap that we lay,” he said on CNN. “The president’s statements this morning are very, very damaging to him in our case,” Mr. Avenatti added. “It directly contradicts what he said on Air Force One relating to his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the agreement of $130,000.” He said that “it is going to add considerable momentum to our efforts to depose the president and place him under oath, because now we have two contrary statements, made within the same month, relating to what he knew about the agreement, what he didn’t know, what his relationship was with Michael Cohen and we’re going to utilize that statement today to argue for his deposition.” The federal investigation is said to be focusing on hush-money payments that Mr. Cohen made to or helped arrange for Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who has also said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Despite his comments on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s advisers have concluded that the investigation into Mr. Cohen poses a greater threat than even the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. The president’s discussion of Mr. Cohen’s legal troubles came during an expansive, wide-ranging and at times rambling half-hour telephone interview on Fox. At times, it sounded as if he was shouting into the phone. Without being asked, Mr. Trump hit on many of his favorite subjects, including his win in the Electoral College in 2016, the no-knock F.B.I. raid on the home of his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and a CNN debate during the Democratic primaries in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s campaign got advance warning of some of the questions, according to emails stolen by Russians and released by WikiLeaks. Unprompted, he attacked former Secretary of State John Kerry (“the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen”), “Sleepy Eyes” Chuck Todd of “Meet the Press” on NBC News (“the guy shouldn’t even be on the show”) and Andrew G. McCabe, the fired former deputy director of the F.B.I. (part of a “crooked” bureau leadership). The president indicated he had watched a CNN town-hall-style program on Wednesday featuring James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired last year, who is now one of his toughest critics (“a lying leaker”). Even the Fox hosts seemed concerned as the president railed at length about the “fake news” media. “I’m not your doctor, Mr. President, but I would recommend you watch less of them,” one of the hosts, Brian Kilmeade, told him. Mr. Trump presented himself as the victim of a far-reaching conspiracy by an establishment out to stop him from changing the system. “I’m fighting a battle against a horrible group of deep-seated people, drain the swamp, that are coming up with all sorts of phony charges against me, and they’re not bringing up real charges against the other side,” he said. “So we have a phony deal going on, and it’s a cloud over my head.” Nonetheless, he gave himself an “A-plus” for his first 15 months in office — pointing to the tax cuts he signed into law, his efforts to roll back business and environmental regulations and his appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court — despite Mr. Mueller’s investigation into whether there were ties between his campaign and Russia in 2016 and whether he has obstructed justice since then. The president raised again his disappointment with the Justice Department and said the special counsel investigation and raids on his former associates’ properties were a “disgrace.” He said he had tried not to interfere in Justice Department matters. But he warned that “at some point I won’t.” Mr. Trump has for months encouraged the Justice Department to investigate his political rivals. “Our Justice Department should be looking at that kind of stuff, not the nonsense of collusion with Russia,” Mr. Trump said. “There is no collusion with me and Russia.” He asserted Mr. Mueller’s office is a coven of Democrats out to get him. “If you take a look, they’re so conflicted, the people that are doing the investigation, you have 13 people that are Democrats, you have Hillary Clinton people, you have people that worked on Hillary Clinton’s foundation,” he said. “I don’t mean Democrats, I mean, like, the real deal.” Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican who was appointed F.B.I. director by President George W. Bush, has assembled a team of career prosecutors and veteran lawyers, some of whom while in the private sector gave contributions to Mrs. Clinton or President Barack Obama. Mr. Mueller’s defenders say he recruited his team based on expertise and skill, not on partisan affiliations. Democrats cited the president’s latest attacks on the Justice Department and Mr. Mueller’s office to argue for legislation approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday meant to prevent Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Mueller without cause by allowing a dismissed special counsel to appeal to a panel of judges. That bill now goes to the full Senate. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Trump’s comments were “embarrassing to America.” “The president seems to live in an alternative reality,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor. “He says things that are patently false and he thinks just by saying them they become true. The amount of 180-degree turns, name calling and blaming — you watch the president this morning and the way he acted, it is so unbecoming of a president and democracy.” In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump also said that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, who is poised to be confirmed as secretary of state, was not originally scheduled to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, during a secret Easter visit. “He wasn’t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,” Mr. Trump said. “They arranged, actually, while he was there to say hello.” But, he added, “it was more than a hello. They got along. They were with each other for more than an hour.” They “had a great meeting.” Mr. Trump said his own coming meeting with Mr. Kim may or may not work out. “It could be I walk out quickly, with respect,” he said. “It could be that the meeting doesn’t even take place. Who knows?” But he credited his bellicose rhetoric with making a breakthrough with North Korea. “Everybody said, ‘This guy’s going to get us into nuclear war,’” he said, referring to himself. “Let me tell you, the nuclear war would have happened if you had had weak people.”     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Alan Feuer and Benjamin Weiser By hiring Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former prosecutor and New York City mayor, as his lawyer, President Trump will not be getting an agile trial tactician or a brilliant legal scholar. Presumably, he will be getting what he wants: a trusted friend and a pit-bull supporter who can argue his side of the Russia investigation on the Sunday morning talk shows and behind closed doors. On Thursday evening, not long after word emerged that he was joining Mr. Trump’s legal team, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged in an interview on CNN that his role would be a “limited” one and would largely focus on offering “a little push” to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to end his investigation into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice or colluded with the Russians. By his own account, Mr. Giuliani seemed to suggest that in defending the president, he would rely on his reputation, cellphone contacts and negotiating skills. Though there was a time when Mr. Giuliani — a former United States attorney in Manhattan — was a courtroom lion who prosecuted Wall Street frauds, corrupt politicians and violent Mafia dons, a season or two has passed since he actually appeared before a judge or a jury. In the past 10 years or so, he has worked less as a lawyer and more as a pundit, security consultant and unofficial diplomat. As an international fixer, Mr. Giuliani has developed something of a niche for working in — and with — troubled or unsavory regimes. He has, for instance, advised the police in Mexico City on how to deal with kidnappings and murders, instructed business leaders in El Salvador to eradicate their country’s rival street gangs and given counsel to the state-run oil company in Qatar. In his televised appearances — often on Fox News — he has offered his opinions on such topics as Black Lives Matter (“inherently racist”) and Beyoncé’s halftime performance at the Super Bowl (an “attack” on the police). He has also been one of Mr. Trump’s most ardent public advocates, supporting the president’s law-and-order platform while relentlessly attacking his opponents. Which is not to say that Mr. Giuliani has let his law license expire. He played a potentially important — if narrow — role last year in the case of Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who was charged in Manhattan with conspiring to violate United States sanctions on Iran. And in 2014, he successfully defended the video game designer Activision Blizzard against a lawsuit from the former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who did not like his depiction in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, one of the company’s most popular games. It is, of course, unlikely that Mr. Giuliani will ever see the inside of a courtroom as the Russia investigation moves forward. The evidence so far suggests that he is planning a campaign of lawyerly diplomacy: less like Clarence Darrow and more like a volatile Clark Clifford. On CNN, for instance, Mr. Giuliani said, optimistically, that he would like to resolve the case in a “couple of weeks.” Marc L. Mukasey, who has practiced law with Mr. Giuliani for more than a decade, most recently at the law firm Greenberg Traurig, noted that while Mr. Giuliani was “not often in the courtroom these days, he’s a counselor and he’ll be a great counselor to the president.” “He has a track record of being a guy who can get things done,” Mr. Mukasey said, “and right now, getting this investigation done is important.” The Zarrab case — which was prosecuted in Mr. Giuliani’s old stamping grounds, Federal District Court in Manhattan — could offer a clue to how he will approach the Russia matter. In that proceeding, Mr. Giuliani has said in court filings that he and Michael B. Mukasey, a former United States attorney general, were retained by Mr. Zarrab to try to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to his case, outside of the court. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey, who is Marc Mukasey’s father, said in court papers that they had traveled to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and also discussed the Zarrab case with Trump administration officials who were outside of the prosecutors’ office. But their efforts appear to have been unsuccessful, as Mr. Zarrab ultimately pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. For several months now, Mr. Trump has been having trouble retaining legal talent, especially as the Russia investigation — and a separate inquiry into his longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen — has started heating up. And according to officials at the White House, one reason that Mr. Giuliani was brought onboard was to beat back the narrative that the president’s legal ship is sinking. With his connections in the Justice Department and his prosecutorial chops, Mr. Giuliani adds some ballast to a legal team that is currently composed of lesser lights. Mr. Trump’s other lawyers — at least, for the moment — include Jay Sekulow, who spent much of his career as a radio and TV host, and Jane Serene Raskin and Martin R. Raskin, who worked as federal prosecutors but are otherwise unknown. “Trump trusts him,” said Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who worked under Mr. Giuliani in the Southern District of New York. “Trump is his own guy and will do his own thing, but he trusts Rudy. He respects him and is more apt to listen to him than he might to someone else.” Mr. McCarthy, now a columnist for National Review, also noted that Mr. Giuliani was well positioned to advise the president on issues arising from the Cohen investigation. “He brings a unique knowledge of how the Southern District works — the bench, the office, the traditions,” he said. Mr. Giuliani also shares the perspective of being investigated: James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., said in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC this week that he had opened an investigation into whether agents in the New York office of the F.B.I. leaked information to Mr. Giuliani about the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s emails. “I got fired before it was finished,” Mr. Comey said, “but I know I asked that it be investigated.” If Mr. Giuliani’s central task is to persuade Mr. Mueller to set down his investigative sword, he is confronting an opponent who is, in many ways, his mirror image. Both men are 73 and spent a good portion of their lives in the federal criminal-justice system. In the early 1980s, when Mr. Giuliani was the associate attorney general, the No. 3 position in the Justice Department, Mr. Mueller was working in the United States attorney’s office in Boston. In 1989, when Mr. Mueller went to the Justice Department and served as an assistant to then-Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Mr. Giuliani was the United States attorney in Manhattan. “He’s a contemporary and a peer of Mueller and the president,” Marc Mukasey said. “He’s somebody with gravitas who’s been on both sides of the table.” Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Nicholas Fandos and Adam Goldman WASHINGTON — President Trump plunged into an angry dispute on Wednesday between conservative House Republicans and the deputy attorney general, siding with hard-line lawmakers over his own Justice Department as they pressed for access to sensitive documents related to the special counsel’s investigation and other politically charged cases. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump called the legal system “rigged” and amplified the lawmakers’ complaints that the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, was not moving fast enough to turn over the documents they want. The president stepped in just as Mr. Rosenstein appeared to mollify three key committee chairmen who were also demanding internal documents. A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal “justice?” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved! “They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal ‘justice?’ Mr. Trump wrote. “At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!” Which presidential powers Mr. Trump was referring to was not immediately clear. Distrust between Mr. Rosenstein and Congress has been building over months. In recent weeks, he has made significant gestures to release documents demanded by prominent congressmen, only to be threatened with impeachment by lawmakers from the far right. Mr. Rosenstein responded on Tuesday to that threat by declaring that the Justice Department would not be “extorted.” Officials at the department believe that the conservatives have now gone too far with document requests related to continuing investigations that the lawmakers clearly do not support, including the inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia’s election interference. A former federal law enforcement official familiar with the department’s views said that Mr. Rosenstein and top F.B.I. officials have come to suspect that some lawmakers were using their oversight authority to gain intelligence about that investigation so that it could be shared with the White House. Mr. Trump’s threat on Wednesday to intervene bolstered those voices and could undermine the Justice Department’s ability to protect some of its most closely held secrets. Lawmakers conducting oversight are usually given summaries of the information, but not the intelligence collected directly from wiretaps and sensitive sources. Similar standoffs between law enforcement officials and Congress have resulted in compromise dating back decades, but in those cases, the Justice Department had the support of the president. Without Mr. Trump’s support, Congress is gaining the advantage. Republican lawmakers, for their part, argue that Mr. Rosenstein’s department has slow-walked important requests and withheld crucial details from documents they do turn over — material they say is necessary to doing their jobs. And their threats are hardly veiled. “Despite his repeated promises to cooperate, Mr. Rosenstein’s supervision of the Department of Justice has been sorely inadequate,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and one of Mr. Rosenstein’s most outspoken antagonists. “Valid investigative requests from Congress have been slow-walked, stonewalled and impeded at each step of the way under his watch.” He added, “If Mr. Rosenstein’s hesitance to produce documents and information to Congress represented an effort to save the Department of Justice from embarrassment, it is too late.” Mr. Rosenstein, aware of the threats against him, has taken unusual steps to try to meet the demands, adding employees to review the requested files and sharing unredacted documents normally off limits to Congress — including memos drafted by the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey about his interactions with Mr. Trump. The department has even set up office space at its headquarters for congressional staff members and lawmakers to review hundreds of thousands of documents already studied by the department’s inspector general, according to a department official. Those efforts have placated powerful Republican committee chairmen. After Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, threatened last month to hold Mr. Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or proceed with impeachment, Mr. Rosenstein gave him access to an almost completely unredacted F.B.I. memo on the opening of the Russia investigation and won his thanks. He reached an agreement last week with the two Republicans who run the committees that conduct oversight of the Justice Department, Representatives Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, to satisfy the last of their demands for documents related to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails and other decisions related to the Russia case. But those compromises may have only emboldened Mr. Trump’s fiercest allies, including Mr. Meadows, the chairman of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a former chairman of the caucus. In an unusual show of defiance, both men have insisted that the agreement with the chairmen of the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees is not good enough and that they need access to an unredacted version of an August 2017 memo outlining the scope of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Democrats fear that the Republican requests — many of which call on the department to ignore longstanding policy about what it shares with Congress — are meant as a trap. Either Mr. Rosenstein can turn over information that could be used to undermine the special counsel’s inquiry, or he could refuse, giving Mr. Trump cover, or even cause, to fire the deputy attorney general. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the latest Republican efforts were “clearly trying to sabotage” Mr. Mueller’s investigation and court a confrontation with Mr. Rosenstein. “All of this noise is aimed at undermining the special counsel’s work as the investigation closes in on the president,” Mr. Nadler said in a statement. “The president’s attacks on the Department of Justice grow more paranoid by the day. The case for obstruction of justice — and the complicity of these House Republicans — grows day by day as well.” Mr. Rosenstein, who has already given the Republican lawmakers access to hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, has made clear in recent days that he does not intend to go further. On Monday, the Justice Department wrote to Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan to deny them access to the document about the scope of the Russia inquiry, citing department policy against sharing information on a continuing investigation. “The department recognizes the keen interest that Congress has in the special counsel’s investigation, but, respectfully, we must adhere to the longstanding position of the department that congressional inquiries pertaining to ongoing criminal investigations threaten the integrity of those investigations,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. “We hope you can respect our position,” he added. And on Tuesday, Mr. Rosenstein, reacting to reports that Mr. Meadows had drafted articles of impeachment to use against him if needed, pushed back hard. “If we were to just open our doors to allow Congress to come and rummage through the files, that would be a serious infringement on the separation of powers,” Mr. Rosenstein said at an event in Washington. “It might resolve a dispute today, but it would have negative repercussions in the long run, and we have a responsibility to defend the institution.” It is unusual for rank-and-file members of a committee to challenge or maneuver around their own chairmen on sensitive matters. But Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows are known as two of the most confrontational Republicans in the chamber. Mr. Meadows has developed a close relationship with Mr. Trump, while conservatives are talking up Mr. Jordan as a candidate to succeed Representative Paul D. Ryan as speaker. Neither lawmaker responded on Wednesday to requests for comment. In an apparent break with both men, Mr. Gowdy, chairman of the Oversight Committee, said on Wednesday that he was “satisfied” that his committee and the Judiciary Committee now had the access it needed to documents relevant to a continuing joint investigation into decisions made by the department in 2016 and 2017. “I appreciate Rosenstein’s willingness to work with the committees, and I have confidence in his leadership,” Mr. Gowdy said, adding that Mr. Mueller should be given “the time, the independence and the resources to conduct a thorough investigation.” Mr. Trump, who has privately fumed about Mr. Rosenstein, has said publicly that the deputy attorney general faced conflicts of interest. The president criticized Mr. Rosenstein for signing a search warrant application to permit federal agents to eavesdrop on one of Mr. Trump’s former campaign aides. Mr. Rosenstein assumed oversight of the investigation and appointed Mr. Mueller as special counsel after the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself last year. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Mr. Sessions for his recusal. The president’s warning on Wednesday was a sharp departure from earlier comments, when he has said that although he is frustrated with the investigation into his campaign, he is not supposed to be involved with department matters. “I am not supposed to be involved with the F.B.I.,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in November. “I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things that I would love to be doing. And I’m very frustrated by it.” But Mr. Trump is increasingly on the defensive, after an F.B.I. raid of the office and hotel room of his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, and the disclosure of more than 40 questions that the special counsel would like him to answer. The questions touch on a variety of topics, including coordination with the Russians during the presidential campaign and actions that Mr. Trump has taken as president and whether they were intended to derail the inquiry.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael D. Shear and Peter Baker WASHINGTON — If there was any chance that President Trump and James B. Comey could have avoided all-out war, it ended Sunday night. That was when ABC News aired an interview with Mr. Comey, the president’s fired F.B.I. director, as he uses a publicity blitz for his searing tell-all memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” to raise the alarm about the dangers he says Mr. Trump poses to the country. [Read annotated excerpts from the full interview here.] While ABC aired one hour of its conversation with Mr. Comey, it had conducted a five-hour interview with him, a transcript of which was obtained by The New York Times. In it, Mr. Comey called Mr. Trump a serial liar who treated women like “meat,” and described him as a “stain” on everyone who worked for him. He said a salacious allegation that Mr. Trump had cavorted with prostitutes in Moscow had left him vulnerable to blackmail by the Russian government. And he asserted that the president was incinerating the country’s crucial norms and traditions like a wildfire. He compared the president to a mafia boss. “Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country,” Mr. Comey told ABC’s chief anchor, George Stephanopoulos, on the program “20/20.” “The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. He is morally unfit to be president.” The interview with Mr. Comey and the publicity tour for his book, which is scheduled to hit bookstores on Tuesday, amount to a remarkable public assault on a sitting president by someone who served at the highest levels in the government. The stakes for both men could hardly be higher. Mr. Comey seems likely to be the star witness in any obstruction of justice case that might be brought against the president by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the sprawling Russia investigation. Mr. Trump’s legal fate, as well as his political fortunes in Washington, may depend on whether he succeeds in undermining the credibility of Mr. Comey and the law enforcement institutions he views as arrayed against him. While many of Mr. Trump’s critics believe that the proper remedy for his perceived transgressions is impeachment, Mr. Comey insisted that would just “let the American people off the hook.” He said the public was “duty bound” to vote Mr. Trump out of office in the next election. “You cannot have, as president of the United States, someone who does not reflect the values that I believe Republicans treasure and Democrats treasure and independents treasure,” Mr. Comey said. “That is the core of this country. That’s our foundation. And so impeachment, in a way, would short-circuit that.” Mr. Comey’s intensely personal attacks — a reflection of his self-righteousness, his detractors say — are all the more combustible because they are aimed directly at a president who has said with pride on Twitter that “when someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more.” As if on cue, hours before the interview aired, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” for the second time in three days, saying in a pair of early-morning Twitter posts that he belonged in jail for what the president said were lies to Congress and leaks of classified information. In another post, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey would go down in history as “the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” He added that “he is not smart!” In the ABC interview, Mr. Comey had kinder things to say about Mr. Trump’s brainpower, saying he did not think the president suffered from mental incompetence or was in the early stages of dementia. He said Mr. Trump struck him as a person of “above average intelligence.” But Mr. Comey responded to the president’s Twitter posts with a more subtle dig of his own. “My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others,” he wrote on Twitter. “3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint.” It is unclear where this epic battle of wills will lead, other than a sustained escalation of insults between two men who have each admitted to having outsize egos. But it is certain to be a test of powerful forces in the modern media landscape: the presidential megaphone, amplified by 50 million Twitter followers, and the global reach of an adversary who is on a seemingly endless, 24-hour, cable-news-driven book tour. The president took a break from his attacks on Mr. Comey as he left the White House on a rainy Sunday afternoon to spend time at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. But it seemed likely that he and his allies would not back down in the face of Mr. Comey’s barrage of public accusations, which are expected to continue for weeks. On ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday morning, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, unloaded on Mr. Comey, calling him a “self-admitted leaker” and a liar. At the White House on Friday, she had called him a “disgraced partisan hack” and a fired employee trying desperately to “rehabilitate his tattered reputation and enrich his own bank account.” Mr. Comey was similarly unrestrained in his ABC interview, speaking with the abandon of a man who finally feels unleashed. He repeated for the cameras some of the assertions from his book that he must know will get under the president’s skin: that Mr. Trump’s hands are “average-sized,” that his skin is “orange” and that he seemed shorter than Mr. Comey had imagined he would be. “His tie was too long, as it always is,” Mr. Comey said. “He looked slightly orange up close with small white half-moons under his eyes, which I assume are from tanning goggles.” Mr. Comey described in vivid detail the interactions he had with Mr. Trump, including meetings and phone calls about which he said he meticulously wrote down notes afterward for posterity. (In another Twitter post Sunday morning, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Comey’s “‘memos’ are self serving and FAKE!”) Some of the most startling assertions by Mr. Comey revolved around his first meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower just days before the inauguration. That day, intelligence officials, including Mr. Comey, briefed the incoming president on Russia’s attempt to meddle with the election. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump and his aides seemed interested only in what the former F.B.I. director called the “P.R. and spin” about the issue. “The conversation, to my surprise, moved into a P.R. conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this,” Mr. Comey said. “I don’t remember any questions about, ‘So what are they going to do next; how might we stop it? What’s the future look like? Because we’ll be custodians of the security of this country.’ There was none of that.” “It was all, ‘What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had?’” Mr. Comey said. It was at the end of the meeting that Mr. Comey said he asked to speak to Mr. Trump alone to brief him on the salacious “Steele dossier,” which contains unverified allegations about Mr. Trump, including a claim that the Russian government has video recordings of him watching prostitutes urinate on one another in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump denied the allegations that day, saying, “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” Weeks later, in a telephone call after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed, Mr. Trump again denied the account in graphic terms, Mr. Comey said. “There’s no way I’d let people pee on each other around me,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey’s account. Mr. Comey said the president also raised the idea that the F.B.I. should investigate the claim as a way of proving that it never happened. Mr. Comey said he warned Mr. Trump that doing so would add to “the narrative” that the president was under investigation. Mr. Comey said in the interview that he did not know whether the episode had taken place, or whether the Russians had material they could use to blackmail Mr. Trump. “I think it’s possible. I don’t know,” Mr. Comey told Mr. Stephanopolous. “These are more words I never thought I’d utter about a president of the United States, but it’s possible.” Mr. Comey also offered additional details about the one-on-one dinner at which he says Mr. Trump demanded his loyalty. “And I said, ‘You will always get honesty from me,’” Mr. Comey recalled. “And he paused and then he said, ‘Honest loyalty,’ as if he was proposing some compromise or a deal. And I paused and said, ‘You’ll get that from me.’” That dinner felt like a mob initiation of sorts, Mr. Comey said in the interview, similar to the ones he often came across as a young prosecutor working to break up the mafia. “I’m not trying to, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and, you know, shaking down shopkeepers,” Mr. Comey said. Instead, it was reminiscent of “the loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything. It’s all about how do you serve the boss, what’s in the boss’s interests. It’s the family, the family, the family, the family.” In one of his Sunday Twitter posts, Mr. Trump insisted that “I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy.” As he does in his book, Mr. Comey largely kept a distance in the interview from the Russia investigation. But he said Mr. Trump must have known that it was improper to ask his other top aides to leave the Oval Office so he could privately ask Mr. Comey to drop the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his just-fired national security adviser. “If he didn’t know he was doing something improper, why did he kick out the attorney general and the vice president of the United States and the leaders of the intelligence community?” Mr. Comey said. “It’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice,” he said, though he added that a prosecutor would need to evaluate “other things that reflected on his intent.” The president has repeatedly criticized Mr. Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email case. On Sunday, he did so again in a Twitter post, claiming that Mr. Comey had admitted in his book that he went easy on her because he thought she would win the election. In fact, Mr. Comey said the opposite in his book, acknowledging that he may have unconsciously assumed she would win when he reopened the email investigation just days before the election, something that many Democrats believe was devastating to her campaign. In the ABC interview, Mr. Comey said he believed at the time that it would be extremely damaging to the credibility of the F.B.I. if the reopened investigation did not come to light until after Mrs. Clinton had won the White House. “If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we’re done,” he said. “We’re no longer that group in America that is apart from the partisans, and that can be trusted.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter Baker and Katie Benner WASHINGTON — The long-simmering friction between President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions erupted into an extraordinary public face-off on Wednesday as the investigation into Russia’s election interference roiled the administration and raised new questions about the independence of law enforcement agencies. Mr. Trump excoriated Mr. Sessions for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry during its early months, calling his attorney general “DISGRACEFUL” in a lacerating Twitter post. Mr. Sessions, who has absorbed blows from the White House since last year mostly in silence, responded with a rare statement defending his “integrity and honor.” The back-and-forth, unthinkable in previous administrations, came during a week of unrest at the White House. As the president railed about the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was stripped of his top-secret security clearance. One of Mr. Trump’s closest aides, Hope Hicks, announced that she will step down as communications director. And Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman was back in court pleading not guilty to new charges. The schism between Mr. Trump and his attorney general has become a persistent subplot of his administration, an almost Shakespearean rift between a president and one of his earliest and strongest supporters. Mr. Sessions was the first senator to back Mr. Trump’s candidacy but has fallen out of favor because the president wanted an attorney general who would protect him and investigate his political enemies. The two rarely speak except in formal meetings, and both sides describe the relationship as broken. In between the president’s tweet and Mr. Sessions’s response on Wednesday, the two stood awkwardly yards apart at a Capitol memorial service honoring the Rev. Billy Graham. Mr. Trump later fumed in the Oval Office about Mr. Sessions’s statement, according to advisers, once again leaving the attorney general’s fate in question. But the president’s options are constrained, advisers said, because he recognizes that he would have a difficult time winning Senate confirmation for a replacement. Mr. Sessions served there for 20 years, and his former colleagues have bristled at Mr. Trump’s attacks. Any dismissal of Mr. Sessions would be taken by Democrats and even some Republicans as an effort to seize control of the Russia investigation and could trigger a bipartisan backlash. The exchange on Wednesday began when the president lashed out at Mr. Sessions for seeming to suggest that the Justice Department’s inspector general would look into Republican charges of misconduct in the opening stage of the Russia investigation rather than opening his own examination. “Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!” Republicans have accused Justice Department and F.B.I. officials of abusing their powers while President Barack Obama was still in office by using information from a dossier prepared by a former British spy paid by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign to justify surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. Officials did not fully inform the court that issues warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, of the origin of the information, Republicans complained. Democrats have called that a distortion and distraction. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, was appointed by Mr. Obama in 2012, but previously worked for the Justice Department under Republican and Democratic presidents. He has already been investigating how James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director until Mr. Trump fired him last spring, handled the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Mr. Sessions seemed to take umbrage at the president’s latest message. “We have initiated the appropriate process that will ensure complaints against this department will be fully and fairly acted upon if necessary,” he said in his statement. “As long as I am the attorney general,” he added, “I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.” Mr. Sessions’s response, polite but pointed, was all the more striking because he had largely kept quiet after previous attacks by the president. Mr. Trump has never forgiven Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, a decision that helped lead to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump has publicly called Mr. Sessions “weak” and said he would not have appointed him had he known Mr. Sessions would step aside. His latest eruption was prompted by Mr. Sessions’s comment on Tuesday that if a FISA surveillance warrant was wrongfully obtained, the matter would be “investigated” by the department’s inspector general. His comment was interpreted as confirmation that the inspector general had opened a second official inquiry on top of the Comey review. But Mr. Sessions only meant to reiterate what he said after a memo drafted by House Republicans was released alleging abuse of the FISA process. At the time, Mr. Sessions said he would “forward to appropriate D.O.J. components all information I receive from Congress regarding this.” The nuance was lost on Mr. Trump, who among other things did not seem to understand that an attorney general cannot order an inspector general to investigate anything, only refer information. “The president’s tweet reveals that he really doesn’t understand how the government works and how the Justice Department works,” said Michael Bromwich, a former department inspector general. He added that the inspector general’s office has a reputation for professionalism. “It’s incredibly demoralizing to have the chief executive of the government not only not understand and appreciate what you do, but attack what you do on a constant basis,” Mr. Bromwich said. Inspectors general at cabinet agencies are kept separate to preserve their independence. Paul Light, a New York University professor and specialist on the offices, recalled that President Ronald Reagan fired all of the inspectors general but was forced by Congress to rehire some of them. “They have protections in statutes against arbitrary dismissal,” he said. After Mr. Trump’s tweet, Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, received support from Republicans, including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that confirmed him. “I have complete confidence in him and hope he is given the time, the resources and the independence to complete his work,” said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Several Republicans expressed dismay at the president’s continued campaign against Mr. Sessions. “It’s kind of mind-boggling that he would call out his own attorney general,” former Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah said on Fox News. Representative Peter T. King of New York, also on Fox, expressed sympathy with Mr. Trump’s desire for a second investigation run by Mr. Sessions, but added that the president should not berate him. “Jeff Sessions is loyal to the president and he’s one of the first to support him, and he’s often in very difficult positions and I think he’s trying to reconcile as best as he can,” he said. Michael W. McConnell, a former appellate judge now at Stanford Law School, said a president has every right to direct his attorney general. “What raises eyebrows is the form and tone of the tweet, which appears to be a commentary on the attorney general’s decisions rather than an exercise of presidential supervisory authority,” he said. “Mr. Trump is the president. If he wants something done differently, he should order that it be done differently, with serious reflection, through proper channels and in the proper form.” Jamil Jaffer, a law professor at George Mason University and former associate White House counsel under President George W. Bush, said social media was not the best way to direct action by an attorney general. “The president has a lot of tools that are a lot more effective than putting the A.G. on blast on Twitter,” he said. But Mr. Trump got support from other quarters. Representative Lee Zeldin of New York and a dozen other Republicans sent a letter to Mr. Sessions on Wednesday urging him to appoint a special counsel to investigate the handling of Mrs. Clinton’s case and the FISA warrant targeting Mr. Page. The Rev. Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of Liberty University, suggested that Mr. Sessions had never really supported Mr. Trump in the first place. “@USAGSessions must be part of the Bush/Romney/McCain Republican Establishment,” he wrote on Twitter. “He probably supported @realDonaldTrump early in campaign to hide who he really is. Or he could just be a coward.” Eileen Sullivan, Michael Schmidt and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting. Follow Peter Baker and Katie Benner on Twitter: @peterbakernyt @ktbenner.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael D. Shear and Alexander Burns WASHINGTON — James B. Comey’s searing tell-all book was met with an aggressive counterattack on his character by President Trump and his allies on Friday, even as many Democrats struggled with conflicted feelings about the man they blame for Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 election. In the book, Mr. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired as F.B.I. director in May, describes the president as “unethical, and untethered to truth,” and writes that he often wondered about Mr. Trump’s refusal to acknowledge Russia’s attempt to influence the election. “Maybe it was a contrarian streak,” he wrote, “or maybe it was something more complicated that explained his constant equivocation and apologies for Vladimir Putin.” He also compares the president to a Mafia boss. Pointed details from the book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” leaked out Thursday night before its official release Tuesday. The response from the president was personal and vicious, even by Mr. Trump’s standards. [Read our review of Mr. Comey’s memoir.] In two early-morning tweets, the president called the former F.B.I. director an “untruthful slime ball” and a “proven LEAKER & LIAR.” Mr. Trump said that it was his “great honor to fire” Mr. Comey. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, escalated the criticism later in the day, saying Mr. Comey will “be forever known as a disgraced partisan hack that broke his sacred trust with the president of the United States.” The Republican National Committee joined in with an all-hands effort to discredit Mr. Comey by distributing lengthy talking points to conservative pundits, sympathetic media hosts and Republican lawmakers. The message was coordinated with the White House’s and echoes Mr. Trump’s. “Comey is a liar and a leaker, and his misconduct led both Republicans and Democrats to call for his firing,” said Ronna McDaniel, the committee chairwoman. The talking points describe Mr. Comey as a “disgraced former official” and a “consummate Washington insider who knows how to work the media to protect his flanks.” It says that Mr. Comey was “strongly criticized by members of both parties for his history of bizarre decisions, contradictory statements and acting against Department of Justice and F.B.I. protocol.” The committee created a “Lyin’ Comey” website and sent out mass emails to reporters litigating the claims in his book and interviews. Foreshadowing the attack Mr. Trump delivered Friday, the committee’s talking points branded Mr. Comey as a leaker consumed with grievances against Mr. Trump and listed Comey-bashing quotes from Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the current Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. Mr. Comey will have an opportunity to respond to his critics during a book tour that will take him to venues across the country. His first major interview, with ABC News, is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night, though the network began airing clips Friday morning after the book leaked out. He will have several other high-profile appearances in Washington, followed by events at bookstores in Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles and other cities. At each, Mr. Comey’s observations about the president’s behavior and character are certain to generate headlines. The Republican National Committee is organizing television and radio bookings for people appearing to rebut Mr. Comey during the tour. Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal advisers, was up early on Friday to question Mr. Comey’s credibility for the TV cameras. “We find that Mr. Comey has a revisionist view of history and seems like a disgruntled ex-employee,” Ms. Conway said. “After all, he was fired.” Fox News, the president’s preferred TV news network, plans to air its own special on Sunday night, “The Trial of James Comey,” at 9 p.m. on “The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton.” Republicans on Friday also leapt at the chance to tie Mr. Comey to Andrew G. McCabe, his former deputy director, after the Justice Department inspector general issued a highly critical report that accused Mr. McCabe of repeatedly misleading investigators. Not all of the personal insults were coming from the president and his allies. At times, Mr. Comey seemed to be doing the same thing in his book, writing at one point that Mr. Trump’s face appeared “slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles.” Mr. Comey’s comparison of the president’s operating style to the Mafia — “The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small” — might have been expected to please Democrats if it had come from someone else. But at least initially, he received a somewhat muted defense from Democrats still angry about the way he handled the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. While they cheered on his fight with Mr. Trump, they argued that Mr. Comey should not have made public the email inquiry the way he did. “He let his own ego get in the way, and it put him in charge of fate that was not his decision to act on,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “I don’t think he had partisan motivations. But there’s a lot of people I know who don’t agree with me on that.” Anger from Democrats toward Mr. Comey cascaded across social media on Friday. Ms. Palmieri said she would urge them not to join Mr. Trump in piling on Mr. Comey, even though she admitted there is “a lot of resentment” toward him. “I don’t agree that he’s an untruthful slimeball,” she said, adding that Democrats should not help the president undermine Mr. Comey’s credibility. “That’s not responsible or productive.” Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey last May eventually led to the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia’s 2016 election meddling and whether Mr. Trump has deliberately tried to obstruct the investigation. In an extraordinary day of testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee the next month, he foreshadowed many of the themes of his book, describing how Mr. Trump had tried to derail an investigation of Michael T. Flynn, who served briefly as national security adviser and accused the president of lying and defaming him and the F.B.I. The former F.B.I. chief’s much-anticipated 304-page memoir is the first major memoir by one of the key characters in the Trump administration. Some of the moments that Mr. Comey describes in the book were already publicly known: He describes a January 2017 dinner where he said that Mr. Trump asked him for a loyalty pledge, an episode that was reported by multiple news organizations last year. But the details cast Mr. Trump and his aides in a negative light. The time Mr. Comey first briefed Mr. Trump on Russian election meddling has also been frequently described. In the book, Mr. Comey added his own description of how a discussion about a grievous intrusion into the American election process became “a strategy session about messaging on Russia — about how they could spin what we’d just told them.” Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York. Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting from Washington.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Giving By Bryan Borzykowski Like many Americans, Brad Hines spent much of September watching hours of hurricane coverage on television. For Mr. Hines, a digital marketing strategist in Boston, the storms hit close to home: Several family members in Florida were affected by Hurricane Irma. As the devastation unfolded, he opened his computer and donated money to the Red Cross, but it was not in cash. He gave in Bitcoin, which the Red Cross has been accepting since late 2014. He could have donated dollars, but, he said, the more he can use the cryptocurrency for buying goods and giving to charity, the more it will be used by others. “I want to pitch in and help get the currency adopted,” he said. “And it’s also fun to use.” It was his first donation with Bitcoin, the virtual currency that was created in 2008, but it will not be his last. As more charities accept digital currency, the more likely he will open his virtual wallet instead of his physical one, he said. Few people are donating to the Red Cross with Bitcoin, with the group receiving just $2,000 worth of the currency in 2017, but the numbers are rising elsewhere. Fidelity Charitable, a $16 billion donor-advised fund, has received $13.5 million in Bitcoin donations this year, up from the $4.1 million it received from November 2015, when the fund started accepting the cryptocurrency, to December 2016. Why would someone donate with Bitcoin over dollars? There are two reasons: It can be tax advantageous, and the technology the currency is built on could make it easier to see how a donation is being used, forcing charities to become more transparent. For many Bitcoin holders, the main impetus for donating their cryptocurrency is taxes. In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service classified cryptocurrencies, which includes Bitcoin and other digital dollars like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple, as an asset, like a stock, which means that sales are subject to capital gains. With a unit of Bitcoin rising to just over $7,000 this month from about $340 in early November 2014, sellers could be subject to hefty taxes depending on when they bought and sold. If they give those coins to charity, the asset is not subject to capital gains and donors still get to deduct the asset’s value from their taxes as a charitable donation. That’s partly why Fidelity Charitable began accepting Bitcoin donations. Its donors were asking about it, and the fund saw an opportunity after the I.R.S. clarified the rules. “We didn’t do anything until the I.R.S. determined that it was going to be treated as an asset,” said Matt Nash, Fidelity Charitable’s senior vice president of donor engagement. “If you look at an overall mix of a portfolio and one asset is gaining value much faster than another, then it’s strategic to donate that asset to charity. You’re getting better overall value for the dollar.” Mr. Nash said that the fund did not accept Bitcoin directly and that it did not hold any cryptocurrencies in its own portfolio. The fund uses Coinbase, a digital asset exchange company, to accept donations and convert them into dollars as soon as they come in. It’s a similar process with stocks. Fidelity Charitable turns assets it receives into cash right away, but it’s even more important that the fund transfers Bitcoins into dollars because of its volatility. Bitcoin fell by nearly 20 percent from Aug 28 to Sept. 11, for instance. Fidelity does not want to be caught holding something that can decline so quickly. Some technology entrepreneurs and cryptocurrency enthusiasts say that the system these currencies are built on can alter how people give and track their donations. Cryptocurrencies use a blockchain, a digital ledger that records transactions. Normally, when someone pays cash for an item in a store, the transaction is seen by only the buyer and the seller. With a blockchain, the transaction is recorded in a digital ledger in near real time that anyone can see. It is also impossible for transaction details to be changed. Because everything is tracked, donors can easily see that their payments have gone from their digital wallets into a charity’s hands. It’s this tracking mechanism that has many in the nonprofit sector excited. If everyone who touches a donation accepts Bitcoin, like the charity and the store providing the supplies, then donors can see how their donations are being used. “Having that tracking mechanism would certainly be something that donors would be interested in,” said Steve MacLaughlin, vice president of data and analytics at Blackbaud, which develops software for nonprofits. “The nonprofit that creates the shortest distance between gift and outcome wins.” Ideally, if donations can be better tracked, organizations will have to be more upfront about how they are spending their money, including how much goes toward overhead, said Andreas Antonopoulos, a Bitcoin expert and author of “The Internet of Money.” “You’ve seen numerous scandals where charitable donations end up being used for operating costs,” he said. “It’s very difficult to see where a donation is going, but this could change that.” Raphaël Mazet, a founder of Alice, a London-based software company that helps charities accept donations, said that end-to-end transparency was a long way off. Most of the organizations that charities give their money to do not accept digital currencies, so tracking stops when a cryptocurrency is converted into cash. Currency volatility is also holding tracking back, Mr. Mazet said. If the value of the currency strikingly drops before it is used, that donation will be worth a lot less than initially planned. His company transfers digital donations into a proprietary coin that’s essentially worth one British pound to avoid those ups and downs. “There is the potential for currencies to be sent around the world, but these issues make it difficult to work with blockchain right now,” he said. Still, technology companies like Alice, and Toronto-based Grace Token, are hoping to revolutionize giving. Both operate on the Ethereum blockchain, which Mr. Mazet said was more sophisticated than the Bitcoin blockchain. It allows people to use smart contracts, which give funders greater flexibility over how their donations are spent. With Alice, which is working with the homeless shelter St. Mungo’s in London, donations are released once the charity meets its goals, like finding a place for someone to stay and receiving mental health care. Those milestones are verified by the Greater London Authority. “Once those goals are validated, payment is triggered and then reported to the funders,” Mr. Mazet said. “So you know that your money has gone to help a person find a flat.” Grace Token, which is still building its software, will work in a similar way. It will allow donors to distribute funds at different times and only if certain goals are met. Funders will also be able to take back unused portions of donations if they feel their money is not being spent properly. “Traditionally, you can’t get your money back or determine how it’s being used,” said Michael Yeung, a founder of Grace Token. “Now we can specify a time or conditions to each donation.” Mr. Mazet will not go as far as to call his technology disruptive, but he does say it is bringing “massive innovation” to how charities track, measure and report gifts. It is likely that as more people start using digital money, the more cryptocurrency donations will be made. If these currencies keep rising, then it will continue to make sense to donate in Bitcoin purely for the tax advantage, said Mr. Nash of Fidelity Charitable. For Mr. Hines, who gave money to the Red Cross using Bitcoin, donating with the cryptocurrency is no different from donating anything else. “It’s easy to do,” he said. “And it lends credence to the currency.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley The rapidly escalating trade conflict with China has upended the prevailing economic dynamic of falling unemployment and faster growth, leaving policymakers and investors scrambling to figure out the way forward. The threat of a trade war loomed over Jerome H. Powell’s inaugural speech as Federal Reserve chairman on Friday in Chicago, even as he tried to focus attention on the fundamental strength of the American economy. Financial markets fell Friday morning after President Trump’s latest salvo against China, then tumbled further after Mr. Powell indicated that the Fed saw no imminent need to adjust its outlook. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the day down 2.2 percent, closing a turbulent week. And there was uncertainty in Washington, where lawmakers, lobbyists and even White House officials struggled to discern how much of Mr. Trump’s move was policy and how much was bluster. The president acknowledged that the trade friction could take a toll. “I’m not saying there won’t be a little pain,” he said in a radio interview on Friday. “But we’re going to have a much stronger country when we’re finished.” The concern over trade was evident at Mr. Powell’s appearance before the Economic Club of Chicago. The Fed chief did not mention tariffs in his speech, but in a question-and-answer session afterward, they were the first topic raised. The Fed chief, who took his post in February, said it was “too early to say” what impact the dueling trade measures would have. “We don’t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be,” Mr. Powell said. But he made it clear that the Fed would watch closely for any sign that the trade dispute was knocking the recovery off course. The trade tensions complicate what was already a tricky task for the Fed. Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts and spending increases risk fueling inflation, as do wage pressures from a robust labor market. The government’s monthly jobs report on Friday, while more subdued than in recent months, still pointed to a healthy employment picture. Yet policymakers are wary of acting too aggressively to slow the economy at a time when wage growth has been tepid. The Fed’s response has been gradual interest-rate increases. A trade war could act as a drag on economic growth, forcing the Fed to be even more cautious. But tariffs could also raise consumer prices by limiting cheap imports from China and other countries. That could increase the risk that the Fed will lift rates too quickly, choking off the recovery. “There’s an immediate, knee-jerk reaction to tighten policy more,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley. The latest escalation between the United States and China came Thursday evening, when Mr. Trump said he was considering tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese imports. That came on top of the tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed last month and those on $50 billion in Chinese goods that he proposed in recent days. China has responded with its own new tariffs. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump will make good on his latest threats. Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s new top economic adviser, has sought to portray the tariffs as an opening bid in a negotiating process with China, and he told reporters on Friday that “there are all kinds of back-channel discussions going on.” But Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, indicated that tensions had reached a more combustible level. “There is the potential of a trade war,” Mr. Mnuchin said Friday on CNBC. “There is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war.” The trade upheaval threatens to undermine an American economy that is at its strongest point since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. Employers have added jobs for 90 consecutive months, by far the longest streak on record; the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000. “The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong,” Mr. Powell said on Friday, referring to the Fed’s policy group. Wage growth, weak for much of the recovery, ticked up in March, and Mr. Powell said he expected the gains to continue in the months ahead. And while workers would, without a doubt, like to see their pay rise more quickly, the gradual pace is comforting for some investors, who have been watching for any hints that the economy is overheating. In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw “other signs of economic strength,” citing “steady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,” which he said would continue to support consumer spending. Other economists agreed, saying that the recently passed tax and spending measures give the economy added momentum. A full-blown trade war might be enough to short-circuit the recovery, they said, but isolated tariffs — even large ones — most likely are not. Certain categories are more vulnerable. Among the retaliatory moves announced by China are new tariffs on soybeans, which could hurt American farmers already struggling with low prices for their crops. The nation’s factories, a sector that Mr. Trump has championed, have become a bright spot in the recovery — a development Mr. Powell underlined on his Chicago visit by touring an incubator for industrial start-ups. But Mr. Trump’s tariffs could force manufacturers to pay more for materials, and China’s countermeasures could hurt their overseas sales. Just the prospect of tariffs — even before they begin to take a direct bite — could hurt the economy if it makes corporate executives reluctant to invest. Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm, said she was already hearing from clients that they are more hesitant to commit to major projects, at least until they see whether this week’s skirmishes develop into an all-out trade war. “We’re not seeing the impact directly of tariffs yet, but we would say there’s pretty broad conservatism as a result,” she said. Mr. Powell said Fed policymakers, too, were conscious of concerns from corporate executives. “We did hear from a number of business leaders around the country that changes in trade policy had become a bit of a risk to the medium-term outlook,” Mr. Powell said in the question-and-answer session. Continued turmoil in financial markets could begin to hurt spending, especially among higher earners, who are more likely to own stocks. Ms. Zentner said surveys suggested that some high-income consumers had already become more pessimistic as markets have become more volatile. “It’s starting to affect those groups, whose spending is more tied to the stock market,” Ms. Zentner said. “If they simply pause their spending or become more prudent in their spending because of market volatility, it drags down consumer spending in the aggregate.” The effect of all this on the Fed’s thinking won’t be clear until the next policy meeting on May 1 and 2. Fed officials raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at their most recent meeting, in March, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Officials indicated that they considered the economy and labor market healthy, and that they expected to raise rates twice more this year and three times in 2019. Mr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. But he also cautioned that policymakers could change course if necessary. “Our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,” Mr. Powell said. “If the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans — one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.” Follow Ben Casselman on Twitter: @bencasselman.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press SHEFFIELD, Mont. — Montana rancher Fred Wacker had thousands of head of cattle fattening up along the Yellowstone River for export to China when President Donald Trump picked a trade fight with the Asian nation. The dispute threatens a $200 million deal that Wacker helped secure last year to ship Montana beef to China, yet the potential setback to his business plans hasn't diminished his stalwart support for Trump. ""I'm not going to follow him over the cliff, but I'll take a pretty good jump,"" Wacker said as a small team of cowboys on his Cross Four Ranch herded hundreds of cattle onto trucks headed for summer pasture. Deep in Montana's ag country, ranchers' and farmers' support of Trump is being put to the test as the president's bellicose threats of a trade war risk their livelihoods. It's a constituency that voted heavily for Trump and that has a lot to lose, both in existing trade and new deals like the one involving Wacker that could send tens of thousands of Montana cattle to China over the next several years. The conflict faced by Trump's supporters in Montana, where some 28,000 farms and ranches make agriculture a top economic driver in the state, is reflective of the one facing the larger U.S. agriculture industry, which also largely backed Trump but now risks becoming a casualty if a trans-Pacific trade war erupts. Wacker, his white cowboy hat pulled down tight atop his head as he weighed the outgoing cattle, remains firmly in Trump's camp. He views the Republican president's aggressive stance on China as unsettling but necessary, and hopes it will bring parity to what has long been a lopsided trading relationship between the two nations. That situation was beginning to reverse itself when Trump reached an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping last year to lift a 13-year ban on U.S. beef exports to China. That opened the door to the deal between Montana ranchers and Chinese e-commerce leader JD.com, Wacker said. Since Trump challenged China on trade, JD.com has ""gone silent,"" Wacker said, but he remains confident in the president's approach. ""We would not even be talking about this if it weren't for the Trump administration,"" he said of the deal he helped broker during a trip to Beijing last year. This largely rural state, once known for its independence in voting for candidates' individual qualities over political party, has grown a deeper shade of red over the past decade as voters increasingly break toward GOP candidates. That trend culminated in 2016 with Trump's 20-point trouncing of Democrat Hillary Clinton in Montana. The GOP now hopes to use that momentum to oust the state's Democratic senator, Jon Tester, in this fall's election. Trump on Saturday called for Tester to resign for what the president called false allegations that scuttled the nomination of Ronny Jackson to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tester did not respond directly but said he would keep fighting for veterans. Tester, who is seeking a third term, is himself a farmer from the little town of Big Sandy and has already used the tariff issue to scold Trump. ""If you put me and my neighbors out of business — not you personally, but the administration — we've got a major problem here,"" Tester told Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue earlier this month. Trump's victory paid off for farmers and ranchers in the form of rollbacks of environmental regulations imposed during the Obama administration that farmers and ranchers considered burdensome, including ones that could affect irrigation ditches, biotechnology and pesticides. Trump's tactics on trade have been more unsettling for the industry. First, he announced plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which caused some Mexico importers to look to South America for crops like wheat. Then, he pulled out of a trans-Pacific trade deal that he viewed as unfavorable to the U.S. After his threats to China elicited a proposal for a retaliatory tariff on U.S. beef, wheat and other products, Trump floated rejoining the trans-Pacific deal to get more leverage over Beijing. He abruptly dropped the idea days later. The whipsaw changes roiled agriculture markets, and not everyone who makes a living off the land retained the same fealty to Trump as Wacker. Wheat farmers in particular worry about how tariffs would affect their market, which has gone through a turbulent stretch in recent years. More than 70 percent of Montana wheat is exported, primarily to Asia, according to the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee. Although less than 10 percent of that grain ends up in China, farmers say the potential for growth in the nation of almost 1.4 billion people is huge. Larry Johnson, a Montana farmer who grows wheat, barley, peas and mustard on nearly 16 square miles (41 square kilometers) near the small community of Kremlin, said he sells some wheat to China, but that's not his biggest concern. What he worries about is that North Dakota soybean farmers will switch to wheat because of Chinese tariffs on soybeans, putting them in competition with him. ""All of our crops are intertwined,"" he said. ""That directly affects our bottom line. I could see a 10 percent loss of income easily."" Johnson described himself as a ""progressive conservative"" — conservative on financial matters and progressive on social issues. He wasn't in favor of either the Republican or Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, but said the agriculture industry's support of Trump is giving way to the realization that the president doesn't understand the industry. Trump's public comments serve only to create uncertainty in the market at an already uncertain time for many farmers, he said. ""One day the president puts a tweet out, and the next day the price of soybeans is down 45 cents,"" Johnson said. ""It makes you very nervous."" The ag industry is keenly aware that China's trade policies have kept U.S. products out of the market there, said Montana Grain Growers Association President Michelle Erickson Jones. She said she agrees with Trump that China must be held accountable, but she favors more conventional routes, such as going to the World Trade Organization. About 280 miles (450 kilometers) east of Johnson's Kremlin farm, Buzz Mattelin grows durum wheat, barley, beets and lentils in Culbertson. He said he is unhappy that his commodities are being used as bargaining chips in a potential trade war, and worries farmers like him will end up as collateral damage. ""I'm patriotic, and I'm going to do my share. But I don't want to bear all the pain, either,"" Mattelin said. ___ Volz reported from Helena. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper SAN FRANCISCO — It took Facebook seven years to raise $1 billion from investors. Uber did it in five. The messaging company Telegram has been around since 2013, but never tried to raise significant money until late last year. Now, thanks to an initial coin offering, or I.C.O., Telegram is on track to pull in a billion dollars in just four months — long before the product the company is raising money for is even built. When programmers or entrepreneurs launch an I.C.O., what they are really doing is selling their own virtual currencies in order to raise money for software they say they are building. In return for real money, investors receive digital tokens, similar to Bitcoin. Regulators worry this novel fund-raising method is allowing people to flout the rules that are supposed to protect investors. Financial authorities around the world have been promising to crack down on coin offerings, which rose out of nowhere last year to become a popular way for start-ups to raise tens of millions of dollars, sometimes in minutes. In recent months, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been sending out subpoenas, asking for information about coin offerings that may have violated the law — although how existing laws may apply remains unclear. Nonetheless, companies like Telegram are still proceeding with their offerings and hoping they can stay out of trouble. Telegram’s supercharged fund-raising has become the most visible and perhaps most lucrative example of an I.C.O. The company has taken in $850 million over the past two months from some of the biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, and it is now aiming to raise another $850 million over the next month or so. A third $850 million round is in the works after that, according to documents associated with the offering. Telegram already runs a popular messaging service. It plans to use the new money to create both an online currency for ordinary people — outside the control of governments — and a new kind of global computing network, combining the attributes of existing virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The project is being led by one of the most vaunted but enigmatic figures in the tech world, Pavel Durov, who built the biggest social network in Russia, VKontakte, before thumbing his nose at Vladimir V. Putin and fleeing the country. He now hops between bases in Dubai and around Europe. Despite Mr. Durov’s credentials, the tech world is divided on the wisdom of putting money into his fund-raising campaign. Some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent venture firms have signed up to invest in the project, including Benchmark, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, according to two people briefed on the private deal who were not authorized to speak about it publicly. But the venture capitalists who have invested the most in the virtual currency space, like Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock and Polychain Capital, have stayed away. “It’s a pitch that sounds good to V.C.s that haven’t participated but makes no sense to people that have been in the space,” said Nick Tomaino, the founder of a virtual currency investment fund, 1confirmation, that didn’t invest in Telegram. The most obvious reason to be skeptical of the project is that there is not even a prototype — just a 132-page paper promising what the system will look like one day. The Telegram team is promising to release the software late this year or next year. What’s more, Telegram is promising to do more than any other virtual currency and to fix the intractable problems that have plagued virtual currencies like Bitcoin, such as overcoming the network’s difficulty handling all the transactions that have poured onto the network as it has become more popular. An analyst at one virtual currency-focused hedge fund, Pantera Capital, wrote a scathing essay noting that the Telegram team has given no evidence that they will be able to solve the problems that have dogged everyone else. “I cannot, in 132 pages, gain the slightest intuition as to how to go about proving that the hard problems it needs to solve will be solved,” the analyst, Charles Noyes, wrote about the Telegram project on Medium. Telegram representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Believers in the Telegram project have said that the company has a team of developers that have already proved themselves by building two incredibly popular tech products, VKontakte and Telegram. Mr. Durov, a self-described libertarian, founded VKontakte in 2006, but gave up his role and his ownership stake in 2013 after Mr. Putin’s allies took control of the company. Since then, Mr. Durov and his brother, who is said to be the technical genius behind the projects, have built Telegram into a messaging giant with nearly 200 million users. (When Facebook raised a billion dollars, it already had half a billion users.) The Telegram app has been popular in authoritarian countries because it promises that all messages are encrypted and protected from government snooping. Its pro-privacy stance has made it popular with many in the virtual currency community. The virtual currency network that Telegram is building, known as the Telegram Open Network, or TON, would allow users of the Telegram app to send each other payments when they are not in the same country. It would be a Bitcoin equivalent to the popular payment systems that messaging programs like WeChat have built. “TON can become a VISA/Mastercard alternative for the new decentralized economy,” said a TON primer that was sent to investors. “We believe that a whole new economy saturated with goods and services sold for cryptocurrency will be born.” The Telegram Open Network will use the idea of the blockchain, first introduced by Bitcoin, to maintain all the records of Telegram’s currency, known as the Gram, on computers around the world, without any central authority. But Telegram is promising that its blockchains will do much more than Bitcoin: serve as the basis for a global super computer, somewhat like the popular Ethereum network. The Bitcoin and Ethereum networks have both struggled to keep up with transactions, but Telegram said it will overcome this by using multiple blockchains that will allow it to process millions of transactions a second. The Bitcoin network limit is currently around five transactions a second. The Telegram documents say that 5 billion Grams will initially be released to users. The investors who put the first $850 million into the project paid 37 cents for each token, according to offering documents. The next round of investors, expected to come together over the next month, will pay about three and half times that for each Gram. If the current round raises another $850 million, Telegram said in documents that it may hold yet another round, to raise $850 million more. The price that Telegram is charging in the current fund-raising round — $1.33 a Gram — assumes the entire currency will grow to be worth at least $6.6 billion. There are already eight virtual currencies worth that much, and all the Bitcoin in the world were worth around $185 billion on Sunday. Given Telegram’s experience, many investors think it won’t be hard to achieve that long term value. Telegram’s team has also been careful to stay on the right side of the law, only offering their token to accredited investors, and working with the established Wall Street law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Telegram initially said in its offering documents that it would do a public sale of Grams, to smaller investors, but it backed away from that after American regulators spoke in congressional hearings in February about their concerns over I.C.O.s, according to the people briefed on the deal. Despite those precautions, many virtual currency investors said the Telegram offering was too risky. “This is an order of magnitude larger than any of the most hyped I.C.O.s we’ve seen,” said Joe DiPasquale, the founder of BitBull Capital, a hedge fund. “As an investor who looks at a lot of projects in this space, that for me is a concern.” Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Ruchir Sharma The announcement that President Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, plans to resign after apparently losing a battle over raising tariffs ratchets up concern that the White House is turning sharply toward protectionism. The deepest fear is that the planned steel and aluminum tariffs will echo the mistake of the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, which provoked a global trade war and helped fuel the Great Depression. The alarmists are getting a bit ahead of the story, however. Periods of deglobalization — when nations begin shuttering their borders to flows of trade, money and people — tended to be slow processes, not sudden events. They started with tectonic shifts — global wars and crises — not minor import levies. And they unfolded over decades, not years. The last era of deglobalization actually began when countries turned inward after World War I, more than a decade before Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression. It is important to view Mr. Trump’s latest trade actions in that historical context. The suggested higher tariffs on steel and aluminum are too narrowly targeted to trigger a trade war but represent another chapter in the evolving era of deglobalization. This era began long before Mr. Trump took office, but he is now capitalizing on the popular backlash against globalization. The mood turned decisively after the Great Recession of 2008. Trade collapsed as a share of the world economy, and despite some pickup in the past two years, trade has yet to recover to its pre-crisis level. One big reason: the barriers that countries like India and Russia have been raising to block the flow of trade, money and people at their borders. In every year since 2010, the leading economies have instituted more discriminatory trade measures than liberalizing ones, according to data from Global Trade Alert. The difference with Mr. Trump is that he is reviving the old-school and easily detected weapon of the tariff. Many other countries have been using a wide array of non-tariff barriers. Some are stealthy, like hidden subsidies for export industries. Others are blatant, like barring foreign competitors outright. Though the world is now a decade into this age of deglobalization — with flows of money and migrants also running well below the peaks reached before 2008 — it’s an exaggeration to compare Trump’s tariffs to a tipping point like Smoot-Hawley. Steel and aluminum represent only 2 percent of United States imports, and so far Mr. Trump’s proposal bears less resemblance to the sweeping Smoot-Hawley tariffs than to the more narrowly targeted Fordney-McCumber tariffs that preceded it. In the early 1920s, European farms were recovering from World War I and emerging as a competitive threat to American farmers, who began lobbying for protection. Fordney-McCumber began as an attempt to answer the farmer’s demands, but once tariff rates were opened up for discussion, other industries like pharmaceuticals demanded and received protection as well. We are at a similar point now: The deglobalization process is underway, in which pressure from other industries, voters and politicians to enact additional tariffs may grow. The outcry for higher tariffs could really intensify if the economy takes a serious turn for the worse, as it did after the stock market crash of 1929. Then, factories shut down and unemployment spiked. That led to the passage of Smoot-Hawley, which triggered a sharp reaction from foreign governments. Global trade slowed sharply and did not fully recover until the 1970s. Today, however, the world economy looks much more like it did in the 1920s than in the depressed ’30s. Unemployment and inflation are low, growth is reasonably strong, inequality is back to levels last hit in the 1920s, and the mood is shifting against globalization. Still, the clamor for protection could grow significantly in intensity. The obvious concern: If Mr. Trump is pushing tariffs during good times, just imagine what he might do if the times turn bad. That’s when governments normally become even more protectionist, and this administration is already moving in that direction. The decision by Mr. Cohn, the head the National Economic Council and a staunch defender of free trade, to leave the administration is clear evidence of the trend. The next chapter in this period of deglobalization may revolve around how Mr. Trump deals with China. If the world’s two largest economies fall into a spiral of tit-for-tat retaliation, the global trend toward trade protection could pick up pace. China is a minor supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States but a major supplier of much else. In the global financial markets, many observers are thus less concerned about the steel tariffs than about the Section 301 investigation launched by the Trump administration against China, which goes well beyond earlier investigations into illegal subsidies for export manufacturers and other stealth trade protection. Instead, the 301 investigation — named after the section of the Trade Act of 1974 that gives the president great leeway to address trade issues — is a broad look at Chinese practices such as investing in American companies to steal technology, penetrating American data networks and lifting technology from American companies that invest in China. In short, the current controversy over steel and aluminum tariffs involves old industries that are shrinking as a share of the global economy and affect about 2 percent of global trade. Even if Mr. Trump’s suggested new tariffs provoke Chinese retaliation in these industries, it would have a manageable impact. A broader trade conflict involving newer sectors such as technology, or that leads to restrictions on foreign investment, could be much more damaging. Of course, this is not the first time in the postwar era that an American president has resorted to trade protectionism. Richard Nixon fought his 1968 election campaign on a mercantilist platform. Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush imposed trade tariffs. The difference then was that America exercised more dominance over the global economy and had greater reason to believe it could squeeze concessions from trading partners. Rising powers such as China are not likely to be as compliant now, and even allies in Europe seem to feel less obliged to placate America. Regardless of how far Mr. Trump goes in pressing tariffs against both rivals and allies, it is important to remember that this is not the beginning of the story, or the end. We are somewhere in the middle. The seeds of discontent against globalization were sown following a period of intensive trade and migration that culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The age of deglobalization is now a worldwide phenomenon that is larger than Mr. Trump. It was coming whether he won election or not. And it is unlikely to end until long after he is gone.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Natalie Kitroeff Less than two days before the Trump administration plans to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its chief trade representative said Wednesday that several of the nation’s top trading partners were in line for potential exemptions. The trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration was talking with Australia, Argentina and the European Union about excluding them from the 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent charge on aluminum. He added that there were plans to talk with Brazil about possible exemptions, and raised the possibility that South Korea could be excluded as the United States continues to hold talks with Seoul over a bilateral trade agreement. Mr. Lighthizer said he favored sparing those countries from the tariffs while talks continue, though he said that decision would be “up to the president.” Mr. Lighthizer said he expected the conversations over exclusions to conclude by the end of April. The administration has already temporarily shielded Canada and Mexico from the tariffs during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Lighthizer’s testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” But Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. “Nobody wins from a trade war,” he said. “We certainly don’t want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 (and growing) billion trade deficit?” President Trump’s tariffs against steel and aluminum imports, designed to protect blue-collar workers, could instead undermine their livelihood. If Mr. Trump decides to exclude Brazil and South Korea from the tariffs, and allows Canada and Mexico to remain exempt, he will have given a reprieve to the four largest foreign suppliers of steel to the United States, together accounting for half of all steel imports. That could make the tariffs less helpful to domestic steel mills. “It raises the question of, if you exempt all of them, who’s left?” said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It will reduce the value of the relief to the domestic industry.” Foreign governments have continued to engage in high-level talks with the administration to make the case for exclusion from the tariffs. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union’s commissioner for trade, said in a statement that she had met with the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, this week to talk about steel and aluminum trade “with a view to identifying mutually acceptable outcomes as rapidly as possible.” Mr. Trump spoke this week with President Emmanuel Macron of France about how Europe and the United States “might come together over tariffs,” a White House official said in a statement. Administration officials have said that the tariffs are intended to counter an influx of cheap metals from China that are entering the United States through other countries. The Commerce Department has cited national security as the premise for the tariffs, saying that the imports are crippling domestic producers and, by extension, the nation’s industrial base. Asked about reports that the administration was preparing a new set of tariffs aimed at China, Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Trump would make a decision “in the very near future.” Mr. Lighthizer has been investigating China’s trade practices since August, including allegations of theft of intellectual property. Mr. Lighthizer indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China. “There are certain technology products that are under assault,” he said. “You have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.” But he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. “You would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,” he said.

China’s surprise move to lift presidential term limits was another power grab by a leader, the latest sign of the world’s tilt toward authoritarian governance. As our reporter writes, autocrats’ power is growing from Russia to Turkey to Southeast Asia. Worse, critics say, the U.S. lacks the moral authority — or even the inclination under President Trump — to oppose the world’s slide toward hard-line control. (“I think Trump is probably jealous,” one analyst said.) China’s censors, meanwhile, worked to erase online discontent about President Xi Jinping’s move amid speculation that it might betray weakness in the Communist Party. And we unpacked the doctrines of Xi Jinping Thought, China’s new reigning ideology, and revisited Mr. Xi’s rise to power. _____ • South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, urged the U.S. and North Korea to start talking, but neither side seemed willing to budge from preconditions that have so far made dialogue impossible. The U.S. reiterated that it was only interested in negotiations aimed at denuclearization, and the North again asserted that its nuclear arsenal was off the table. Analysts said Mr. Moon was running out of time to make good on his vision for inter-Korean cooperation. _____ • The Boko Haram fighters arrived at the school with guns blazing. Horrifying details are still emerging of a kidnapping last week in northern Nigeria. As many as 110 girls have been missing since the raid on Feb. 19. Nigerians were all the more outraged that the attack mirrored a similar Boko Haram kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014. Officials say more than 100 of those girls are still missing. President Muhammadu Buhari called the latest abduction a “national disaster.” _____ • There was no end to the horror in Syria, despite a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire. The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, demanded the resolution be respected to allow relief aid and evacuations for 400,000 people trapped in Ghouta, a besieged suburb of Damascus. One resident called it “an uninhabitable hell.” Russia ordered a daily humanitarian truce, but it was unclear what effect it might have on the Syrian government, which continues to rain destruction on the area.

Ms. Ardern later said she was “taken aback, but not offended.” Mr. Wooley was unrepentant, calling the criticism “a bit Orwellian.” _____ • “Black Panther” may soon join the $1 billion club.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa has had its distinctive tilt since shortly after construction began in the 12th century, but it was on this day in 1964 that the Italian government decided things had gone too far. Despite its location in the Piazza dei Miracoli (the Square of Miracles), the tower had become one miracle that needed a little human help to survive. To prevent the loss of a national treasure — and tourism gold mine — the authorities in Italy asked for suggestions on how to correct the tower’s 13- to 14-foot lean from perpendicular. But people had been offering advice long before that. The Times reported in 1972 that, in the previous 60 years, more than 200,000 people had sent letters to the mayor of Pisa with their thoughts on how to save the monument. And previous attempts had gone awry, most notably one from Benito Mussolini in 1934. The Italian dictator decided a leaning tower wasn’t a fitting symbol for his country, so he had holes drilled through the floor and 80 tons of concrete poured into the foundations. It promptly lurched another few inches toward the ground. The tower was finally stabilized in 2001, after an 11-year, $26 million restoration project.

Technology,"Advertisement By NELLIE BOWLESJAN. 13, 2018  SAN FRANCISCO — Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There’s a surge in people looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, its stock rose 500 percent in a day. In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it’s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys. The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order. The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than 13 million accounts that own cryptocurrencies. Data suggests that about 94 percent of the Bitcoin wealth is held by men, and some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners. Advertisement There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize. Advertisement They also remember who laughed at them and when. James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether. “One like,” he said, pointing to his phone. “It got one like.” Whether it’s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There’s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers. Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn’t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week. “I do I.C.O.s. It’s my thing,” he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. “It’s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.” An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an “Augur token” that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the value of Augur, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion. About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner’s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. “You can I.C.O. anything,” he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced “awesome”). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes. “They’re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,” he said. “But for me, it’s too early in my career to check out.” Advertisement He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (Mayan Warrior) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. “I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it’s gone up six x since then,” he said. He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all. A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he’d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: “Probably not,” he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he’s skeptical that it can add to his life. “I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,” he said. A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest. “Nothing feels real, it doesn’t feel real,” he said. “I’m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I’ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.” Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse. Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital. “My neurons are fried from all the volatility,” Mr. Hummer said. “I don’t even care at this point. I’m numb to it. I’ll lose a million dollars in a day and I’m like, O.K.” His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, ‘The Lizard of Wall Street,’ with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, “memento mori,” to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse. Advertisement “The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,” Mr. Hummer said. ""It’s almost like the ultimate short trade.” Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency. He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn’t give specifics other than to say he’d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There’s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they’ll be targeted and robbed since there’s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don’t know how much they’ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course. “It’s unforgiving,” Mr. Buttram said. “You make one mistake and it’s all gone.” They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency’s founder frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini. Mr. Buttram says he’s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin “B” necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL. This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, “hold” typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don’t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically. “HODL when everyone has FUD,” Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. “This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.”  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

He knows this is strange. “When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,” Mr. Hummer said. “It’s just a different level of consciousness.” The tone turns somber. “Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,” Mr. Buttram said. Mr. Hummer said, “A bomb would set back civilization for years.” A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder’s apartment. James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for “going full YOLO” and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him. Advertisement “I’m taking over her education,” Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms. Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers. “It’s the entire world reorganizing itself,” Mr. Fickel said. “We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you’ll have people saying, ‘I want to vote for a global order.’ It’s the internet waking up — it’s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That’s the blockchain.” Mr. Hummer is skeptical. “All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,” Mr. Hummer said. At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel’s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum. “I’m retired, man,” Mr. Chen said. “I’m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.” “Don’t say I’m retired,” he added. “I’m going into business now. I’m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.” Nearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group. “Obviously the bubble’s going to burst and everyone’s going to need a lawyer,” she said. At the annual San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup Party, hundreds gathered under the fluorescent lights of a co-working space, and there was a line out the door. The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from Hodlmoon, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters. Advertisement Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He’s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology. “The technology still needs time to evolve,” Mr. Wuille said. ""This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can’t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.” He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. “I tell them I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know!” “There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that,” said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. “But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.” As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform. Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said. He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.” He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.” Advertisement Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news. She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her. “Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. ""And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.” She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this. “And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.” She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press FRANKFURT, Germany — The leaders of Germany, France and Britain are ready to push back if the Trump administration does not permanently exempt the European Union from new import taxes on aluminum and steel imports, German Chancellor said Sunday. Merkel said in a statement that she has spoken with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May since returning from her Friday talks in Washington with U.S. President Donald Trump. The three European leaders ""agreed that the U.S. ought not to take any trade measures against the European Union,"" which is ""resolved to defend its interests within the multilateral trade framework."" The chancellor's statement did not outline specific steps the 28-nation EU might take. The EU's temporary exemption from the tariffs expires Tuesday. The tariffs are aimed primarily at overcapacity among state-backed firms in China that have flooded global markets with cheap steel. European leaders have argued that their countries shouldn't be held responsible for China's practices. Visits to the White House by Macron and Merkel last week produced no immediate change in the expiration date. May's office said in a statement after the prime minister's Sunday call with Merkel that they and Macron ""pledged to continue to work closely with the rest of the EU and the U.S. administration with the aim of a permanent exemption from U.S. tariffs. In March, Trump imposed duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The step drew retaliation from China and has led to fears of a wider trade war that could hold back the growth of the global economy. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters BEIJING — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will lead a delegation to Beijing this week to meet with Chinese officials and try to ease the escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. The meetings set for Thursday and Friday are the highest-level in-person talks since U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods in early April, a move quickly matched by China. Although Trump has railed against the U.S. trade deficit with China, and threatened to impose tariffs on a further $100 billion in Chinese goods, the dispute reflects Washington's growing impatience over China's industrial policies and market access restrictions. China, for its part, increasingly sees itself as operating from a position of economic strength under President Xi Jinping. Beijing has expressed willingness to negotiate and ease restrictions on participation in sectors including autos and finance, but it is less likely to yield on its longer-term practice of providing heavy state support to key industries. Since Trump's threat of further tariffs, Chinese officials have walked back, at least publicly, suggestions that they would cut a deal. They have stated repeatedly that moves to open the country's economy will be made at a pace that suits Beijing, not as concessions to U.S. demands. Nonetheless, bipartisan support for countering China's trade practices has grown in Washington, where policymakers increasingly voice a need to inflict some cost upon Beijing for what they see as predatory state capitalism.  Even if the two sides strike a truce or agree to a cooling-off, deep differences over Chinese industrial policy are expected by many economists, industry officials and diplomats to persist for the foreseeable future.  TRADE GAP The Trump administration has demanded that China immediately cut $100 billion from what it says is a $375 billion trade surplus with the United States. China argues that the United States should increase its own exports, pointing out strong Chinese demand for U.S. high-tech products on which Washington imposes export restrictions.  The U.S. business community has warned that Trump should not be fixated upon the trade deficit, and should instead focus on opening market access for U.S. companies in China. Many economists argue tariffs - sure to elicit a Chinese backlash - would hit U.S. consumers and may not change prevailing trade dynamics. IP THEFT AND FORCED TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER U.S. complaints about Chinese intellectual property, or IP, abuses are at the core of the current dispute. The Trump administration says U.S. companies lose hundreds of billions of dollars annually to China's theft of trade secrets. Washington points to weak IP protection in Chinese courts run by the ruling Communist Party, which has set explicit requirements for replacing foreign technology with home-grown alternatives. The U.S. Trade Representative's Office also accuses Beijing of often making access to key Chinese markets conditional upon tacit agreements that American companies transfer technology and other IP to Chinese partners, which Beijing denies. Chinese authorities have taken measures to step up IP enforcement, although critics argue progress is largely in terms of copyright and trademark enforcement, while technology transfer in strategic industries remains rampant. MADE IN CHINA 2025 China is looking to catch up with rivals like the United States and Germany in high-end technology by pouring billions of dollars into its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy to turbocharge development in 10 key sectors, including robotics, aerospace and clean-energy cars. The drive is core to Xi's push to make China an advanced economy and less reliant on imports of key technologies from its industrial rivals. It is less likely to be an area where Beijing would cede ground to placate U.S. negotiators. Trump's chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, due to join this week's talks, said on Tuesday he was not looking to negotiate changes to China's state-driven economic system, but would seek to expose it to more foreign competition. INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS Both countries restrict investment in key sectors, with the United States' tightening access through its CFIUS legislation and planning to further curb Chinese access in certain industries. China's trade partners, including some officials in the European Union, have warned that increased scrutiny of Chinese foreign investment would be an inevitable response to a lack of reciprocal access for their companies in China.  Xi has promised to raise the foreign ownership limits in the automobile, shipbuilding and aircraft sectors ""as soon as possible"" and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector. Washington has looked skeptically upon such pledges, given what it considers vague, unfulfilled promises in the past. The foreign business community in China sees such reforms as long overdue and potentially too late: domestic competitors have used decades of being sheltered from foreign competition to establish dominant market positions at home while expanding abroad. CURRENCY Trump last month accused Russia and China of devaluing their currencies while the United States raises interest rates, which Mnuchin later described as a ""warning shot."" Indeed, the dollar has weakened substantially against the Chinese yuan since Trump took office. Another point of leverage China holds is its $1 trillion-plus portfolio of U.S. Treasury bonds. But deploying the so-called ""nuclear option"" of slashing its Treasury holdings would be self-defeating for China, undermining the value of its portfolio, driving up its own currency and making its exports more expensive.

By Jeff Sommer Even if you don’t follow financial markets closely, if you have money in those markets it is worth considering, every so often, where you have been and where the currents may be taking you.  In a nutshell, the stock market in the United States has generated enormous wealth for investors, and in recent months it has roared ahead with scarcely a setback, raising questions about how sustainable those gains really are. Bonds haven’t performed as spectacularly as stocks. There have been signs that fixed-income markets just may be ready for a long-awaited shift in direction. We’ve selected nine articles with reporting and analysis on where the markets have been and some clues on where they may be heading. Together the selection provides an introduction to investing. We hope that at least some of these articles will entertain you as well.  A rare calm has settled over the stock market, which has been prospering with barely any downturns. That condition is highly unusual, and some fear that it raises the odds that share prices will descend.  Read more » Green bond funds seek securities with clear environmental benefits.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Each week, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Good morning, readers! Let’s talk about tech. The stock market hasn’t been kind to new consumer start-ups. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has been dogged by sluggish user growth since it hit the market last summer; its stock price is still below its $17 I.P.O. price. Blue Apron, the meal delivery start-up, is also trading far below what investors paid for its stock last June. The apparel retailer Stitch Fix, meanwhile, has gained some ground since its I.P.O. in November, but only barely. Now Spotify thinks it can buck the trend. After months of windup, the music-streaming company filed documents this week to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange. It isn’t doing an initial public offering but instead a novel model called a direct stock listing — but let’s forget about the mechanics for now and consider its prospects. On the surface, it looks like a tough road for Spotify. The company is beset by wealthy competitors, is losing tons of money, and its business model does not offer an obvious path to huge profits. But it has one thing going for it, and it’s huge: Spotify is excellent at what it does. None of its competitors match its pace of innovation and its wide cross-platform functionality. And although many musicians remain suspicious of Spotify, it offers the best path forward for the industry — a chance to thrive outside the cross hairs of Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook. Spotify’s filings suggest strong growth. The company has 159 million active users, 71 million of whom pay for a subscription to its ad-free service. Its revenue in 2017 was almost $5 billion, up 38.6 percent from the year before. But its losses also piled up; its operating loss was $461 million in 2017, up slightly from $426 million in 2016. There’s a path here to success. Spotify’s grand theory is that as it grows, it can negotiate better rates with music labels, which then increases its chance of profitability. That’s happening — its gross margin is rising — but slowly. And it’s always going to have huge content costs; Spotify has to pay for music every time it’s streamed, whereas video streaming companies like Netflix usually pay for content just once. But Spotify is worth rooting for. It’s one of few examples of a thriving consumer company that sits outside the clutches of large American tech firms. (It’s based in Sweden.) Its independence makes it great for consumers — Spotify works just about everywhere, from your iPhone to your Amazon Echo to your cheapo Android tablet. Because music streaming is all the company does, it has an incentive to keep improving its service; Spotify, I’ve noticed, adds excellent features faster than most of its bigger competitors add basic ones. That’s the best reason to hope it survives. Last month, I asked readers to send in ideas for tech stories they’d like to see covered in The Times. I expected to get a handful of responses; instead we were inundated with hundreds of thoughtful suggestions. And I read all of them! Thankfully, most of you were brief. So, what would you like to see more of? A lot of things, it turns out. Many people were interested in cryptocurrencies and the blockchains behind them. What did they want to know? The basics, really, like what’s the deal with cryptocurrencies, what is a blockchain and why is everybody suddenly talking about both? We actually have some great explainers by our Bitcoin reporter, Nathaniel Popper — and stay tuned for more. There was also a lot of interest in “algorithmic bias,” the suspicion that the computers making so many decisions about our lives might not be fair or transparent. Readers were also interested in technologies for people who aren’t thought of as a natural audience for new tech — older people, for example, or people in rural areas. “Don’t overlook the folks who are being left behind,” said Michael Starks of Zionsville, Ind. Many had concerns about security. They wondered if the cloud was really secure, and if there was anything they could do to make themselves safer online. That’s an area Times reporters are constantly digging into, but for now, the brief answer is: You’re never as safe as companies say you are. Finally, there was an interest in up-and-coming tech, even tech that’s way out there. Important as they are, people are sick of hearing about Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Twitter. They want to know about quantum computers, flying cars (oh, look, we got you covered there), any manner of robots and the start-ups behind them. And even beyond that: “All these billionaires, yet no one is making serious ground on time machines or teleportation?” asked one reader. Good question! So, some news: This will be my last newsletter for a few months. Like my nemesis Mike Isaac, I’m going to write a book about my hobbyhorse — how Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are conquering the world. When I get back, I hope they put me on the time travel beat. See you then! Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art. You can follow him on Twitter here: @fmanjoo.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Ana Swanson WASHINGTON — President Trump’s promise to take tough action against China’s unfair economic practices was one of his most popular campaign ideas. But as the United States prepares stiff trade measures and China retaliates, stock markets have plummeted and some of America’s biggest companies are pushing back. Industry giants like General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as agricultural companies, have lodged objections with the White House, saying that tariffs on both sides of the Pacific and limitations on investments will cut off American companies from the world’s most lucrative and rapidly growing market. China imposed tariffs on Monday on more than 100 American products, including pork, fruit, recycled aluminum and steel pipes. Fears of an incipient trade war between the world’s two largest economies sent the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index tumbling 2.23 percent and pushed markets into correction territory. Technology stocks bore the brunt of the slump, as a recent spate of bad news about tech companies like Facebook, Tesla and Amazon spooked investors. Asian and European markets fell more modestly in early Tuesday trading. China’s action could be an escalation in a much broader trade dispute. The announcement was a direct response to the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, which were directed at a range of countries, including China. Since then, the White House has announced another trade measure targeted at China that would place tariffs on at least $50 billion worth of products imported to the United States and would restrict investment flows between the two economic giants. This week, the Trump administration is expected to announce a list of Chinese imports subject to tariffs, which could include high-tech products like semiconductors as well as cheap electronics and other goods that many Americans buy. Josh Kallmer, the senior vice president for global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, an advocate for companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and IBM, said his group had been largely supportive of the administration’s targeting of China’s unfair trade practices. But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs “as the primary or even a significant remedy.” “The reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,” Mr. Kallmer said, “precisely the people we are trying to support.” Many of the trade measures that Mr. Trump has proposed, including the steel and aluminum tariffs, have divided his advisers, the business community and the Republican Party. But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China’s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach. That theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers. American companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities. Late last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers. As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry’s seemingly united front. Companies in technology, investment and other industries now say that the measures the administration is taking to help them may actually end up doing irreparable harm to supply chains they have built up over decades. Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China’s growing market, executives say. Technology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China’s importance as a market for exports. The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars’ worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico. “Because we’re so blessed to have America feed the world, we’re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,” Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition. “American farmers appear to be the first casualties of an escalating trade war,” said Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and a chairman of a group called Farmers for Free Trade. “With farm incomes already declining, farmers rely on export markets to stay above water. These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.” Since Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China’s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said. However, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China’s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property. Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs — most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt. Restrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments. The measures come on top of proposed legislation in Congress to expand the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign deals for national security concerns. Last month, the committee stalled a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, a California-based chip maker, by a Singapore company, largely over concerns about ceding semiconductor prowess to China. G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad. Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy. White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures. Speaking Monday on CNBC, the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, defended the administration’s tough actions on China and said investors should not fear a trade war. “Everybody needs to relax,” Mr. Navarro said. “The economy is as strong as an ox.” Follow Ana Swanson on Twitter: @AnaSwanson.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press WASHINGTON — The White House's on-again, off-again tariffs are heightening uncertainty for U.S. companies that buy steel and aluminum and the foreign companies that supply them. And major American allies, from Europe to Canada and Mexico, are signaling increasing resentment. Delivering its second reprieve for steel and aluminum imports, the Trump administration late Monday postponed the tariffs that had been set to take effect Tuesday. But it decided to limit the delay to 30 days. After that, no one knows what the administration will do. ""It's nice to have a little breather,"" said John McDonald, an executive at Trans-Matic Manufacturing, a supplier of precision metal components in Holland, Michigan, which buys $16.5 million in steel annually, some of it from Finland, the Netherlands, Russia and Taiwan. But ""the uncertainty is going to continue,"" McDonald said. ""We're struggling with supply availability, lead times."" With the potential conflict only delayed, the European Union, which has vowed to slap tariffs on American bourbon, motorcycles, blue jeans and other goods if the U.S. taxes its steel and aluminum, warned that it won't ""negotiate under threat."" The delay comes just as the United States prepares for high-stakes trade talks with China this week over Beijing's efforts to challenge U.S. technological dominance. The rift with the EU and other allies stems from the Trump administration's decision in March to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. In doing so, it made the unusual claim that a dependence on imported metals posed a national security threat to the United States. But it soon backed off, for a time. It granted the EU, Mexico and Canada exemptions from the tariffs that were to expire Tuesday before they were extended for a month at the last minute. Separately, the United States has reached a deal with South Korea, which agreed to limit steel shipments to the U.S. in exchange for being spared the tariffs. Some analysts suspect that the Trump trade team hopes to pressure the EU and others to accept quotas on their steel exports to the United States as the price for having the tariffs lifted. Speaking Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer avoided saying whether the administration would be willing to extend again the one-month delay in the tariffs. Lighthizer also said ""we more or less have an agreement"" to permanently exempt Argentina, Australia and Brazil from the metals tariffs. The U.S. is seeking to use the tariff threat to pressure Canada and Mexico to rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement more to President Donald Trump's liking. Among other things, Trump wants to see more auto production moved to the United States. But Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says ""Canada and Mexico look at the NAFTA negotiations as a long-term deal. They're not going to take shortcuts and agree to a bad deal that has long-term implications"" just to escape the immediate threat of steel and aluminum tariffs. ""The administration has created a moment of crisis but made it very difficult politically for all sides to get out of this and still claim victory,"" Bown says. In the meantime, manufacturers that buy steel and aluminum are struggling with uncertainty. The Swedish appliance maker Electrolux in March postponed plans to modernize a plant in Springfield, Tennessee. That decision had consequences for the tool-and-dye maker Vaughn Manufacturing in Nashville, which has been supplying Electrolux for years. Vaughn has had to delay plans to expand its staff of 60 until the tariff situation is resolved. Tuesday's extension of the tariff reprieve ""just lengthens the uncertainty,"" says Mark Vaughn, the company president. The U.S. tariffs would likely raise steel prices in the United States, thereby increasing costs for American manufacturers that buy steel and putting them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign rivals that can buy cheaper steel. ""If those tariffs were to hit, our prices would go up and we would no longer be competitive,"" says Trans-Matic President Patrick J. Thompson. ____ AP Economics Writer Martin Crutsinger contributed to this report. ____ Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Another View By Richard Lumb There has been much discussion about the potential of blockchain, the technology underlying virtual currencies like Bitcoin, to change the world. We have heard waves of inspired commentary on how the technology, with its ability to share information and record transactions, will be as revolutionary as the internet itself. At Accenture, we agree about these huge possibilities, but there is an elephant in the room that will need to be confronted. One of the accepted virtues of blockchain is that it creates a permanent, immutable ledger of transactions. For example, each of the roughly 160 million Bitcoin transactions that have occurred since the cryptocurrency began in 2009 will stay on that ledger as long as Bitcoin exists. That permanence has been vital in building trust in the decentralized currencies, which are used by millions of people. But it could severely limit blockchain’s usefulness in other areas of financial services relied on by billions of people. By clashing with new privacy laws like the “right to be forgotten” and by making it nearly impossible to resolve human error and mischief efficiently, the blockchain’s immutability could end up being its own worst enemy. The financial services industry needs to face the question of how to balance the appeal of pristine accounting with the demands of the real world, where some things simply need to be struck from the records. This challenge is coming to light with new data privacy rules like the European Union’s general data protection regulation, which will add new consumer data privacy and ownership rights over the next two years. These rules will not just affect Europe; they will have a far-reaching impact on global companies, and not least on the back offices of major financial institutions. Entities anywhere in the world that handle personal data belonging to Europeans will be affected by such laws, and infractions could lead to fines of 4 percent of revenue. Little wonder that Accenture clients are asking how they will defend the “right to be forgotten” rules using blockchain technology that always remembers. Blockchain’s immutability could eventually run at odds with existing regulations, too. For example, the United States Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-P all require personal financial data to be easily redacted. For blockchain purists, simply questioning the immutable nature of the technology is a heresy to be resisted. Like the early internet pioneers who saw e-commerce as a crass concept that would spell the end of the web as a place for “cooperation and helpfulness,” many of today’s strongest blockchain advocates, though often highly inventive and visionary, tend to be more idealistic than pragmatic about blockchain’s evolution. (It’s worth noting that the internet, arguably the world’s primary social fabric, now also supports commerce between two billion people every day.) For example, a hacker exploited a programming error this spring in a self-executing blockchain “smart contract,” stealing more than $60 million of “ether” (another digital currency) from a start-up fund called the  Decentralized Autonomous Organization. When lawyers argued that the hacker was entitled to the assets under the erroneous code, a surprising number of blockchain purists agreed. Even after the project’s leaders succeeded in winning a consensus of participants to bifurcate the code at a point before the transaction occurred, a large number of participants continue to use the version of the chain where the theft occurred. One thing is clear: If the financial services industry is to embrace a new technology, it cannot be one in which mischief and mistakes are immutable and fraudsters can defend their actions on spurious ideological grounds. Even the smartest contracts can be susceptible to human error, and even the cleverest I.T. architectures will be hit by events that need to be undone. We need the means to solve this challenge, while maintaining blockchain’s vast strengths. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a prototype that would enable blockchains to be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators. The venture capital community has invested more than $1.4 billion in blockchain applications over the last three years, according to the World Economic Forum. This year alone, banks and technology companies are expected to spend more than $1 billion out of their own pockets to develop the technology. But if blockchain is to move beyond cryptocurrency and lab experiments to real and profitable deployments, we need to challenge conventional orthodoxy and rethink the role of absolute immutability. Perhaps we will then soon be able to read more about blockchain’s achievements rather than its potential. Richard Lumb is Accenture’s group chief executive for financial services.
