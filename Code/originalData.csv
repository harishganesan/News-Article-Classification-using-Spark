Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press An NFL team in London? Count on it. An NBA franchise in Mexico City? Yep, that's coming too. What was once a pipe dream ‚Äî major-league teams based in cities outside the United States and Canada ‚Äî is now just a matter of time. The aforementioned cities are the ones most likely to break through first, but others will surely follow when everyone sees how much potential revenue is there for the taking. ""The market is saturated in the U.S.,"" said Gil Fried, a professor and chair of sports management at the University of New Haven. ""They need to find new markets."" The NFL has been trying for years to make inroads in Europe ‚Äî especially London ‚Äî and those efforts were turned up to full blast by revelations that Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan is attempting to buy Wembley Stadium, a 90,000-seat, state-of-the-art venue known the world over. Khan brushed off the obvious speculation that this is the first step toward moving the Jaguars to London ‚Äî where they already have been playing ""home"" games since 2013 ‚Äî but didn't exactly provide a resounding vote of confidence for Jacksonville, one of the smallest markets in the NFL. ""The first thing you want with certainty is you want a venue,"" he said. ""And this gives us a stadium solution, for us or anyone else."" In other words, better get used to calling his team the London Jaguars. ""Shad Khan's purchase of Wembley Stadium portends that a substantive NFL presence in London, and ultimately a franchise, is inevitable,"" said Vince Benigni, a professor of sports communication at the College of Charleston. The NBA, which last expanded in 2004, is looking to get the jump on Mexico City, a sprawling metropolis of more than 20 million people that opened an NBA-ready arena in 2012.  That facility hosted a pair of NBA regular-season games each of the last two seasons , drawing an average of more than 20,000 fans. ""You can feel it, you can smell it, you can breathe it in the streets."" said Gilberto Hern√°ndez, president of the Mexican Basketball Federation. ""They're just craving basketball."" Of course, there are a number of challenges that must be addressed before international expansion becomes a reality ‚Äî especially so for Mexico City, which is 7,350 feet above sea level (more than 2,000 feet higher than Denver), is plagued by crime and economic-disparity issues, and might have trouble signing top players who are reluctant to step outside their cultural comfort zone. But the appeal is enormous. ""It's the largest city in the Western Hemisphere,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. ""It's part of a 130 million-person country. There's a very strong, passionate Mexican-American fan base in the United States. This is also a potential gateway for all of Latin America."" The NHL first floated the prospect of a European division in the late 1960s. Detroit Red Wings owner Bruce Norris was so fixated on the idea that he launched his own team, the London Lions, who played a 72-game schedule against top European teams in 1973-74. Unfortunately, the Lions never had a league of their own, so the team quietly disbanded after that single season, leaving behind nothing more than a cool logo . Over the last two decades, the NHL has scheduled regular-season contests in Europe and Japan, including two games in Stockholm this past November. The Asian market also remains a top priority, especially heading into the 2022 Olympics in Beijing ‚Äî though the league sent mixed signals by refusing to send its players to this year's Winter Games in South Korea. For the NHL and the NBA, the enormous travel times between North America and either Europe or Asia remain the biggest obstacle to adding teams in those markets. Unless some sort of supersonic transportation becomes available, it would simply be too difficult to incorporate such faraway cities as London and Tokyo into an 82-game schedule, which requires teams to play games all through the week and sometimes on back-to-back days. Also working against European expansion: the lack on U.S.-quality arenas (even the most modern facilities generally lack the size and amenities to generate as much revenue as their American counterparts) and established basketball and hockey leagues in many countries would surely object to the NBA or NHL coming in to steal their limelight. For the NFL, the challenges aren't nearly so daunting, and the potential rewards could be even greater for a league that has faced declining TV ratings and lots of bad publicity about the devastating physical toll on its players. There are no major pro football leagues in Europe. Teams play only once a week, generally on Sunday, and the entire regular-season schedule is just 16 games. A team in London would have to make the cross-Atlantic trek no more than eight times a year, and the demands could be lessened by scheduling back-to-back road games, halving the number of long-range roundtrips. A London team could even maintain its base of operations in the U.S., essentially playing all its games on the road but perhaps making it easier to sign players in free agency and cope with legal issues and currency fluctuations. Travel would not be a concern for a Mexican team. The NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball have all played regular-season games south of the border ‚Äî next weekend, in fact, the Los Angeles Dodgers will meet the San Diego Padres in a three-game series at Monterrey . MLB seems the most logical candidate to launch a Mexican team, given baseball's popularity and the large number of Latin American players in the majors, but the NBA is leading the way. Silver wants to put a G League development team in Mexico City, testing the waters for a possible NBA franchise. ""As we look down the road, frankly, to see whether there can be an opportunity to even dream about an NBA franchise here in Mexico City, we believe it makes sense as a first step to have a development league team here to work out some of the issues, to better understand what it would mean to have a team in Mexico,"" Silver said. There are still plenty of questions to answer, that's for sure. But one is crystal clear. Are U.S. leagues going international? No doubt about it. ___ Paul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press. Write to him at pnewberry@ap.org or at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Sports,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 26, 2018, 6:01 P.M. E.D.T.  CLEVELAND ‚Äî  The NBA said LeBron James' block in the closing seconds of Game 5 on Indiana's Victor Oladipo should have been called goaltending. In the league's Last Two Minute Report posted Thursday, the NBA said the three officials missed the call with 5.1 seconds left. The league said the video shows James blocked Oladipo's shot ""after it makes contact with the backboard."" Under league rules, the play could not be reviewed because it wasn't called on the floor. James then hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Cavaliers a 98-95 win and a 3-2 lead in the series. The Pacers did not contest the block while on the floor, but later in their locker room they complained about the no-call. The NBA's report also said the Pacers were incorrectly awarded the ball on a play with 27.6 seconds left. The ball went off Indiana's Thaddeus Young and went out of bounds, but the referees gave the ball to Indiana. We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

Sports,"Advertisement By SARAH LYALLJUNE 9, 2017  CLEVELAND ‚Äî Sports arenas for successful franchises can sometimes seem interchangeably generic, all noise and flash and money. But if there are two places that can be said to reflect the character and ethos of the teams that play within them, they are surely the basketball arenas in Oakland, Calif., and Cleveland. You might start with their names: Oracle Arena, named after a multinational computer technology company based in the rich community of Redwood Shores, Calif.; and Quicken Loans Arena, named after a national mortgage company based in downtown Detroit. (Some people in Cleveland call it the Q, but Quicken Loans it is.) As is so often the case with places in California, Oracle is situated right off the highway. It‚Äôs hard to get there without driving or using public transportation. In Cleveland, by contrast, Quicken Loans is right downtown, next to the Cuyahoga River. Speak to Warriors fans at a home game, and they‚Äôll tell you straight out how much they love their team and who wouldn‚Äôt? Have the same conversation in Cleveland, and Cavaliers fans will answer with passionate reveries about their love for their city, and how city and team are symbiotically linked. Advertisement They‚Äôll mention Cleveland‚Äôs old reputation as a symbol of backwater parochialism and Rust Belt decline, and how all that has changed with a resurgent economy, the improved fortunes of the Cavaliers and also the Indians, and the Republican National Committee‚Äôs decision to hold its convention here last year. Advertisement ‚ÄúCleveland had so many problems,‚Äù said Sandy Smart, 71, who was at Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals here on Wednesday. She brought up two classic incidents that still haunt the public imagination: the time the Cuyahoga caught fire, in 1969, and the time the mayor‚Äôs wife declined an invitation to the White House in order to attend her regular bowling league, in 1972. ‚ÄúBut now the city is really wonderful,‚Äù Smart said. The contrast between the two arenas has become only more striking now that they are the sites for this year‚Äôs finals. Last Sunday, when Golden State was pounding Cleveland in Game 2 ‚Äî the Warriors now lead the series, three games to one ‚Äî the mood at Oracle Arena was brash, self-congratulatory, unsurprised, as if the Warriors‚Äô dominance was as much a natural right as the shiny presence of the Teslas, Priuses and Porsches that dotted the parking lot outside. Quicken Loans on Wednesday, though, was a sea of slogans about the team‚Äôs (and the city‚Äôs) underdog status. Many fans wore T-shirts saying, ‚ÄúDefend the Land,‚Äù with ‚ÄúLand‚Äù being both a nickname for Cleveland and a signifier of the proprietary feeling its residents have for their town. ‚ÄúCleveland Against the World,‚Äù it said on the Jumbotron, which is so enormous here that it‚Äôs known as the Humongotron.  ‚ÄúThere will always be doubters,‚Äù the board said at another point, ‚Äúbut Cleveland fans stick together.‚Äù Oracle Arena can have a kind of improvisational feel, as if it just now happens to be home to the endless party that is the world‚Äôs best basketball team. But it never lets you forget that its fans live in Northern California, with all its attendant preoccupations. ‚ÄúA lot of people want gluten-free hot dogs or burgers,‚Äù said Delilah Gaden, who works at an Oracle concession stand featuring (healthy) grilled food. ‚ÄúOr they‚Äôll ask what kind of oil is in the popcorn, or if we use real butter.‚Äù The veggie burgers are the same kind you can get at Whole Foods, Gaden noted, adding, ‚ÄúJust because they‚Äôre fans, doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt also be vegetarians.‚Äù That makes sense, said Mark Figueiredo, 46, a businessman and longtime Warriors fan who was buying Chinese food (MSG-free) at Oracle during Game 2 on Sunday. ‚ÄúA lot of people are allergic to gluten,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the difference between the Bay Area and the Midwest. Vegans, vegetarians, fruitarians, pescatarians ‚Äî we have it all here.‚Äù (That, and Larry Page of Google, who was sitting in front of him at Game 1, he said.) Advertisement At Quicken Loans, even the food stands were Cleveland-themed. Cleveland on the Rocks was the name of a bar in the concourse, with ‚Äúon the‚Äù written in tiny letters, inside the ‚Äúo‚Äù in Rocks. Another stand featured ‚ÄúThe Best Chefs in the Land‚Äù and their signature dishes, including ‚ÄúChef Heather Haviland‚Äôs Reuben Balls,‚Äù basically Reuben sandwiches shaped into balls, coated with bread crumbs and deep fried. ‚ÄúSure, people here might ask about the ingredients if they have a peanut allergy or are vegetarians,‚Äù said John Kitko, a salesman for a company selling erosion-control geotextile products, who was raising money for charity by volunteering at the Quicken Loans Quaker Steak and Lube concession stand. (‚ÄúLube,‚Äù in this context, means beer.) ‚ÄúBut in Cleveland you‚Äôre going to get some nice cooked kielbasa and pierogies.‚Äù The songs blaring from the loudspeakers before Game 3 included ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô ‚Äù by Journey and ‚ÄúDream On‚Äù by Aerosmith. When the drum fill in Phil Collins‚Äôs ‚ÄúIn the Air Tonight‚Äù came on, a whole hallway of Cleveland men began reflexively air-drumming. The Warriors have their share of passionate fans who stuck around during the ignominious years and are now reveling in their current great fortune. But the come-lately fans from the Bay Area‚Äôs high-tech world, old-time fans say, have changed the experience, pricing out some of the locals. Tickets for the finals, they said, can easily resell for $5,000. Some fans wistfully recalled the days when you could buy a family package ‚Äî four seats, four meals ‚Äî for under $100. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a middle-class kid, you can‚Äôt afford it anymore,‚Äù said Albert Blackwell, 60, a doorman in his 17th season as a fan, whose Game 2 ticket was a gift from a friend. At Oracle, people were not spending a ton of time thinking about Cleveland. But in Cleveland, at least in the fans‚Äô minds, the contrast was striking. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre shiny and glossy and fueled by tech money and start-ups,‚Äù said Pradeep Giri, 33, a manager at PricewaterhouseCooper. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre a lunch-pail, blue-collar team. They have Eddy Cue and the Apple and Google execs down on the floor. Here we have the guy who owns 20 car dealerships.‚Äù In 2019, the Warriors are set to move to a brand-new arena in San Francisco.  But Quicken Loans Arena has tied its identity not just to the Cavaliers, but to Cleveland itself. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe popular television show ‚ÄòThe Drew Carey Show‚Äô was set in Cleveland,‚Äù you read above one of the arena gates. ‚ÄúCleveland‚Äôs Willard Park is home to the world‚Äôs largest rubber stamp,‚Äù it says atop one of the women‚Äôs bathrooms on the main concourse. And down the hall: ‚ÄúCleveland‚Äôs own Arthur Lovett invented the first padded bicycle seat in 1897.‚Äù As heartbroken as they were after the loss in Game 3, Cleveland fans said there was no need to lose faith in a city that has more than proved its worth to the rest of the country. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had such a good run,‚Äù Giri said. ‚ÄúWe won the finals last year. The fact we made it this far, this is gravy.‚Äù So the Cleveland fans streamed out of the Q, dejected but not despairing. Their faith in the Cavaliers would more than pay off in Game 4 on Friday night. And besides, they also have the Indians. (Plus the Browns, a fixer-upper team that managed to win just one game last year, losing the other 15.) ‚ÄúCleveland has an identity, a brotherhood ‚Äî we‚Äôve been through so much,‚Äù said Joel Bailey, 55, an executive in an electric company. (‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hold that against me.‚Äù) ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Charlie Brown, and one day the Great Pumpkin will come.‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on June 10, 2017, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Cleveland or California,No Mistaking the Home Team.

Technology,"Advertisement By NATHANIEL POPPERDEC. 12, 2017  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Indiegogo helped take crowdfunding mainstream. Now the company is hoping it can do the same for initial coin offerings, the popular but unregulated practice of selling custom virtual currencies to raise money for software projects. Indiegogo started a new service on Tuesday to vet coin offerings, also known as I.C.O.s, and then help sell them to small and large investors. The first project to use the service, a start-up known as the Fan-Controlled Football League, will begin raising $5 million on Indiegogo this week. The start-up aims to use the money to create a league of football teams that will be guided by people who buy the league‚Äôs coins (a crazy-sounding idea that has already been tested). ‚ÄúWe want to bring a brand of trust to the entire industry, which we think will bring I.C.O.s to the mainstream,‚Äù said Slava Rubin, one of the founders of Indiegogo. Advertisement Smaller crowdfunding platforms like Republic and AngelList have started their own efforts to legitimize coin offerings. But until now, established companies essentially avoided coin offerings because of the numerous legal risks and uncertainties. It was, however, becoming increasingly hard for Indiegogo to ignore the market. Advertisement Programmers, entrepreneurs and scammers have raised over $3.5 billion through coin offerings this year, according to Coindesk, after rising out of almost nowhere. That is more than the best-known company in crowdfunding, Kickstarter, has helped companies raise in its entire eight-year history. Initial coin offerings have been so hot ‚Äî and some say so unhinged ‚Äî that some companies have found success with them even after failed crowdfunding campaigns. An online art gallery known as Maecenas, which failed to raise 400,000 pounds (currently about $533,000) through crowdfunding this year, raised $15 million a few months later through an I.C.O., the Financial Times has reported. Established companies have been left out of the I.C.O. craze, in large part because of the legal uncertainty. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, has said several times ‚Äî most recently on Monday ‚Äî that many coins should be categorized as securities and be registered with the authorities, which almost no projects have done. The agency has recently cracked down on a number of projects that aren‚Äôt legally compliant. Indiegogo will help coin offerings follow the law by registering them as securities in most cases. This approach puts many restrictions on investors and on projects. Small investors will be allowed to invest about $10,000 in most projects, and companies will be able to raise no more than $1 million from these investors, because of restrictions put in place by the 2012 JOBS Act. That is a tiny amount compared with the tens of millions of dollars that many coin offerings have raised this year. Projects going through Indiegogo will be able to raise more money from sophisticated investors. But these investors will also face limitations, such as lockup periods, before they begin selling their tokens to others. Advertisement These restrictions could make the new service unattractive. Most coin offerings have been able to garner unlimited amounts of money from any investor; the biggest have raised over $200 million. And at least so far, regulators have cracked down on few of them. Several law firms have already been working on creating legally compliant methods of initial coin offerings. Indiegogo is working with one of those firms, Cooley.

Sohrob Farudi, the chief executive of the Fan-Controlled Football League, said he was willing to accept the restrictions involved in working with Indiegogo to stay on the right side of the law. ‚ÄúWe want to be sure that nobody on our side is going to jail and that when we bring this product to market that it will be done the right way,‚Äù Mr. Farudi said. His group previously raised $63,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to create a minor-league football team guided by fans. Now it is hoping to create a full league with the same principles. The league will begin this week with what is known as a token presale. Early next year, it expects to do a full initial coin offering, and will likely look to raise around $30 million, Mr. Farudi said. At that point, the people who invested in the presale will receive coins, also referred to as tokens, at a discounted rate. When the league opens next summer, people who hold the tokens will be able to vote on everything, from what color the jerseys should be to what plays the coaches should call during a game, with votes taken in real time. The tokens will initially be stored and recorded on the ledger, or blockchain, associated with the Ethereum virtual currency network, though recent congestion on the Ethereum system has the league looking at other blockchain alternatives for the long term. Mr. Farudi said having the tokens on a virtual currency blockchain would allow every vote to be recorded for all the participants to see. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe voting mechanism has to be transparent,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe blockchain is the best example we could find for how to implement that.‚Äù When the league does its I.C.O., Indiegogo plans to categorize it as a so-called utility token, rather than a security, because its main purpose will be to allow for voting on league decisions. Utility tokens come with fewer restrictions than securities. Mr. Rubin of Indiegogo said most companies doing coin offerings would probably have to register as securities. For now, he thinks that coin offerings won‚Äôt make sense for most companies, given the additional complications. In the long run, though, he has joined the chorus of believers who think that all investments are likely to be done on some sort of blockchain because of the way it allows decisions and changes of ownership to be recorded transparently. ‚ÄúOver time, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a discussion ‚Äî I think all of it will be on a blockchain infrastructure,‚Äù Mr. Rubin said. ‚ÄúThe New York Stock Exchange, or the Nasdaq, 20 years from now will be on blockchain. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Justin Bank A few years ago, I installed a web browser extension that swapped out the word ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù any time it appeared on a website in my Chrome browser. In its place? The ridiculous phrase, ‚ÄúSnake People.‚Äù Why? Well, why not. The word millennial was being used to describe many different kinds of millennials in many different millennial think pieces. Once I installed the extension, any tendentiously oversaturated sentence would be transformed into something absurdly sublime. The creator of the extension, a designer named Eric Bailey, eventually added other preposterous text-swapping constructions to his software. And so my web browsing experience was peppered not only with mentions of Snake People, but also ‚ÄúZolom‚Äôs Children‚Äù (for the emerging Generation Z) and the ‚ÄúTime of Shedding and Cold Rocks.‚Äù (for the Great Recession). Harmless fun! An amusing distraction for myself during my time online. Or so I thought. That text-swap functionality about the Great Recession got me in a spot of trouble last week. As many people around the internet noticed, The New York Times had to issue a correction when an errant copy/paste job led to the fictitious ‚ÄúTime of Shedding and Cold Rocks.‚Äù appearing in a trade policy article I worked on. Browser extensions, when used properly and sensibly, can make your internet experience more productive and efficient. They can make thesaurus recommendations more accessible, create to-do lists in new tabs, or change the color scheme of web pages to make them more readable. There are thousands available for Chrome (or other browsers like Firefox and Safari) that you can easily download and try. Just click through, follow the directions to install, and a little bit of web code will leave these Easter eggs of joy and efficiency for you to find while you write your emails, read articles, work in Google docs or do anything else within your browser. Unfortunately ‚Äî if somewhat comically ‚Äî my use of that extension last week was far from joyful or efficient. But, despite my embarrassment to have distracted from the good work of my colleagues, I still passionately recommend the subversive, web-altering extensions you can find in a category the Chrome Web Store lists as ‚Äúfun.‚Äù These goofy diversions inject subtle, delightful surprises into your browsing experience, breaking up the tedium that sometimes comes with being a deskbound office worker. Visual extensions are among the most popular of this genre. According to the publicly listed statistics in the Google Web Store, 152,000 users have installed the Libdoge extension, which allows you to overlay pictures of dogs on top of web pages as you browse. More than 313,000 users have the TabbyCat extension, which gives you your own interactive digital cat to feed and pet. Befitting the community of code-savvy folks who make extensions, many of these browser add-ons satirize tired technology tropes. For example: You can replace ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù with the phrase ‚Äúmultiple copies of a giant Excel spreadsheet;‚Äù or ‚Äúinternet of things‚Äù with ‚Äúwifi enabled toaster;‚Äù or the nebulous-sounding ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù with ‚Äúbutts.‚Äù Fans of Randall Munroe‚Äôs xkcd can install an extension that brings one of his comics to life, turning words commonly found in news articles into slightly more entertaining variations. The benign word ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù becomes ‚Äúavenge‚Äù; the phrase ‚Äúcongressional leaders‚Äù morphs into ‚Äúriver spirits.‚Äù There are, of course, plenty of political text-replacing extensions. ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù created an extension that renders President Trump‚Äôs tweets as if they were ‚Äúa child‚Äôs scribble.‚Äù Another extension blocks mentions of the name ‚ÄúHillary Clinton‚Äù from appearing on web pages. And if you want to unlock your own creativity, there is also an extension called Word Replacer that allows you to choose and update your own catalog of words and phrases to be swapped in and out. However, a word of caution: If you do install these extensions, please remember the dimensions of the alternate digital reality you‚Äôve created for yourself.

Politics,"Advertisement By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and EILEEN SULLIVANMARCH 21, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump defended on Wednesday his decision to disregard the advice of his national security team and congratulate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on his re-election, lashing out at the news media for reporting on how he diverged from his script and attacking his predecessors for failing to improve relations with Moscow. Mr. Trump, enraged after officials leaked the contents of confidential notes he was given for the private phone call on Tuesday that exhorted him ‚ÄúDO NOT CONGRATULATE‚Äù Mr. Putin, argued in a pair of tweets on Wednesday afternoon that the conversation was part of his effort to foster better relations with Russia. He said such engagement could help the United States confront a host of national security challenges. ‚ÄúI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also),‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to President Barack Obama‚Äôs call to Mr. Putin in 2012. ‚ÄúThe Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong!‚Äù But Mr. Trump‚Äôs handling of the call and his defense of it also pointed up his aversion to confronting Mr. Putin about Moscow‚Äôs misdeeds, which has become a theme of his presidency even as a special counsel investigates Russia‚Äôs efforts to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Advertisement Mr. Trump‚Äôs own advisers had warned him against congratulating Mr. Putin and, in briefing cards prepared before the call, told him to raise Moscow‚Äôs role in a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter living in Britain, an instruction he also ignored. The Washington Post first reported on the briefing cards, a leak that stunned some senior officials at the White House, where aides said on Wednesday that John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, had been deeply disappointed and frustrated by the disclosure. Advertisement One senior White House official said Mr. Trump had never seen the briefing cards. Another said the president had been determined not to antagonize Mr. Putin, believing that his rapport with the Russian leader was the key to better relations between the countries. It was that rationale that Mr. Trump appeared to embrace on Wednesday. ‚ÄúGetting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing,‚Äù the president wrote. ‚ÄúThey can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race.‚Äù The president also took on his predecessors, both Republican and Democrat, saying they had been incapable of forging better relations with Moscow. ‚ÄúBush tried to get along, but didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòsmarts,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote. ‚ÄúObama and Clinton tried, but didn‚Äôt have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET).‚Äù He was referring to the policy of Hillary Clinton, his 2016 campaign rival, who as secretary of state in Mr. Obama‚Äôs administration pursued a ‚Äúreset‚Äù with Russia aimed at turning around a dysfunctional relationship.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. The call revived questions about Mr. Trump‚Äôs stance toward Mr. Putin just after his administration had taken its most aggressive steps against Moscow, moving last week to impose sanctions for Russia‚Äôs interference in the election and other ‚Äúmalicious cyberattacks.‚Äù The United States also joined Britain, France and Germany in denouncing the Russian government for violating international law for the attack on the spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia. Still, since his first face-to-face meeting with Mr. Putin over the summer, Mr. Trump has consistently refused to criticize the Russian president directly. In November, after a meeting with Mr. Putin on the sideline of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Danang, Vietnam, Mr. Trump said the Russian president ‚Äúmeans it‚Äù when he denied having meddled in the 2016 election, and was ‚Äúvery insulted by‚Äù the charge, which is the conclusion of American intelligence agencies. Advertisement Mr. Trump began his day on Wednesday indirectly criticizing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for the Russia investigation, continuing to attack him by name against the advice of his own lawyers. ‚ÄúI was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council,‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter in quotes he attributed to Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School. ‚ÄúI think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!‚Äù It was not immediately clear on Wednesday which remarks of Mr. Dershowitz‚Äôs the president was quoting. An interview with Mr. Dershowitz on Fox News on Tuesday and an opinion piece by Mr. Dershowitz published on Wednesday did not include the exact phrasing that Mr. Trump used in his tweets. And the language was not found in a search of Mr. Dershowitz‚Äôs cable news appearances over the past week. Justin Bank and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Gardiner Harris WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Trump administration imposed new sanctions on seven of Russia‚Äôs richest men and 17 top government officials on Friday in the latest effort to punish President Vladimir V. Putin‚Äôs inner circle for interference in the 2016 election and other Russian aggressions. The sanctions are designed to penalize some of Russia‚Äôs richest industrialists, who are seen in the West as enriching themselves from Mr. Putin‚Äôs increasingly authoritarian administration. Effectively, the action prevents the oligarchs from traveling to the United States or doing business or even opening a bank account with any major company or bank in the West. It also restricts foreign individuals from facilitating transactions on their behalf. Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former sanctions official in the Obama administration, described the penalties as ‚Äúfairly muscular‚Äù and predicted that more sanctions are probably coming. They grow out of Washington‚Äôs oddly disjointed policy toward Russia: While President Trump has called for good relations with Mr. Putin, Congress and much of the rest of the administration are pushing through increasingly punitive efforts that are sinking relations with Moscow to lows not seen in years. ‚ÄúNobody has been tougher on Russia, but getting along with Russia would be a good thing, not a bad thing,‚Äù Mr. Trump said this week. By Friday, according to a White House statement, he had dropped any qualification. ‚ÄúWe cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord and rancor to be successful,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. Friday‚Äôs list targets Mr. Putin‚Äôs inner circle. It imposes sanctions on a family member, his son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, who has had close business ties to one of Mr. Putin‚Äôs longtime friends from St. Petersburg, Gennady Timchenko. It also penalizes people like Vladimir Bogdanov, the director general of Surgutneftegas, a large privately owned oil company that has long been rumored, without solid evidence, to have given an ownership stake to Mr. Putin. The list is an assault on one of the oligarchs‚Äô favored tools for avoiding sanctions, which is to pass assets to their children. It targeted the oil executive Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg, who is a former judo partner of Mr. Putin and whose companies have won a host of state contracts, including one for the construction of a bridge from the Russian mainland to Crimea, the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014. Also on the list is Oleg V. Deripaska, who once had close ties to Mr. Trump‚Äôs former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. Altogether, the Trump administration targeted seven oligarchs, 12 companies they own or control, 17 Russian government officials and a state-owned arms export company. ‚ÄúThis list sends a very clear signal to Putin himself that we‚Äôre not afraid to go after your friends and their children,‚Äù said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert at the Brookings Institution. ‚ÄúThere is some real thinking in this.‚Äù Russia‚Äôs Foreign Ministry promised a ‚Äúharsh response‚Äù and described Washington‚Äôs increasing use of sanctions as economically anti-competitive. The sanctions have been under consideration for some time. A senior administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity said that they responded to Moscow‚Äôs continuing and increasingly ‚Äúbrazen pattern of malign activity‚Äù worldwide ‚Äî especially against Western democracies. ‚ÄúThe Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites,‚Äù Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. ‚ÄúRussian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government‚Äôs destabilizing activities.‚Äù The sanctions come just as investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, have begun to question Russian oligarchs about possible financial links between those in Mr. Putin‚Äôs orbit and people close to Mr. Trump. Friday‚Äôs penalties could be particularly painful for Mr. Putin‚Äôs regime. While Russia‚Äôs oligarchs make nearly all of their money in Russia, many stash their families, their lovers and much of their wealth in places like London, New York and Miami, where they are believed to own hundreds of millions of dollars in property. However, the economic strain is likely to be delayed, given that most on the list have already shielded their assets. Targeted sanctions against the oligarchs are seen as a particularly good way to punish Moscow‚Äôs aggressive moves while sparing wider Russian society, which is already suffering under Mr. Putin‚Äôs thumb. The sanctions come just three days after Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, in his final speech as Mr. Trump‚Äôs national security adviser, warned darkly about the growing Russian menace. ‚ÄúFor too long some nations have looked the other way in the face of these threats,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd we have failed to impose sufficient costs.‚Äù The new sanctions stem from legislation passed by Congress overwhelmingly last year and designed to limit Mr. Trump‚Äôs ability to lift sanctions already imposed on Russia. Lawmakers in both parties feared that the president would suspend sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama as he pursued warmer relations with Moscow as promised during his campaign and first year in office. The Trump administration opposed that legislation but quietly acceded to it after it passed with a veto-proof majority. Within that law was a measure requiring the administration to create a list of Russian oligarchs. Lobbying around the creation of the list became intense as Russia‚Äôs wealthiest citizens feared punishing sanctions to come. That is exactly what happened on Friday. The sanctions list will only hasten the slide of Washington-Moscow relations. This week, 60 American diplomats left Russia as part of a tit-for-tat series of expulsions that followed last month‚Äôs nerve-gas poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter. Mr. Skripal‚Äôs poisoning on British soil prompted more than 20 countries to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers, the largest such coordinated action ever. British officials believe that Mr. Skripal‚Äôs poisoning, which occurred after an assassin smeared a nerve agent on the door handle of his home, was such a risky operation that it was unlikely to have been undertaken without approval from the Kremlin. Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning. But the attack is seen as part of a pattern of increasingly aggressive moves by Mr. Putin, including the seizure of Crimea; military interventions in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria; tacit support for President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs chemical attacks on his own populace in Syria; a direct attack by Russian mercenaries on American troops in Syria; and the hacking of elections in the United States and Europe. The Trump administration‚Äôs responses to Mr. Putin‚Äôs needling have been uneven. Although Congress gave the State Department $120 million in 2016 to counter Russian hacking efforts, the department has so far spent none of it. And Mr. Trump said this week that he wanted American forces to leave Syria soon, an exit that would benefit Iran, Russia and one of its allies, Mr. Assad. But the administration has also imposed considerable economic penalties on Russia, with Friday‚Äôs action the latest in a string of similar moves. NATO allies are now thinking anew about more coordinated responses to track and impose sanctions on Mr. Putin‚Äôs cronies. Both Congress and the British Parliament are considering legislation that would require that the owners of companies and properties be disclosed. Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Moscow.

Politics,"Advertisement By BEN PROTESS, MIKE McINTIRE, STEVE EDER and JESSE DRUCKERMARCH 17, 2018  The investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election has expanded to include President Trump‚Äôs family business, with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, subpoenaing the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia. For more than 30 years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to conduct business in Russia. He traveled to Moscow in 1987 to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have met with Russian developers and government officials on multiple occasions in search of joint ventures. But the company says nothing has come of it. Mr. Trump tweeted in January last year, shortly before his inauguration: ‚ÄúI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA ‚Äî NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!‚Äù So what about the Trump Organization‚Äôs Russian connections might be of interest to Mr. Mueller? Perhaps the closest Mr. Trump came to launching a real estate project in Russia was during the presidential campaign, when he signed a letter of intent in late 2015 for a Trump hotel to be built in Moscow. Ultimately, the deal never materialized. Advertisement In email exchanges with Mr. Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian √©migr√© who had previously helped develop Trump SoHo in New York, talked about securing financing for the Moscow project from VTB, a major state-owned Russian bank under American sanctions. He also mused about how the deal, if supported by Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir V. Putin, would ‚Äúfix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce & business are much better and more practical than politics.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,‚Äù Mr. Sater wrote in one of the emails. Mr. Trump signed the letter of intent with Andrey Rozov, a developer of retail and residential projects in the Moscow region. If the deal went through, Mr. Trump would receive a $4 million upfront fee in exchange for licensing his name, and his company would manage the completed hotel. By January 2016, the project seemed to have stalled. At one point, without success, Mr. Cohen emailed an aide to Mr. Putin seeking help jump-starting it. There is no evidence the Kremlin provided any assistance for the project. The Trump Organization has said that it received no government approvals or financing and that the effort was abandoned in early 2016. Mr. Trump‚Äôs business opportunities in Russia got little traction until he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013. A father-son pair of real estate developers, Aras and Emin Agalarov, paid nearly $20 million to license the Miss Universe name, bringing the contest to their Crocus City Hall in Moscow. As an owner of the pageant, Mr. Trump flew to Russia in November 2013 to participate. He became friendly with his partners, who were known to have been helpful to the Kremlin. The visit left an impression on Mr. Trump and had him contemplating future endeavors with the Agalarovs. Advertisement ‚ÄúI had a great weekend with you and your family,‚Äù Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in a message to Aras Agalarov. ‚ÄúYou have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,‚Äù he wrote, before referring to Mr. Agalarov‚Äôs son, a pop star: ‚ÄúEMIN was WOW!‚Äù While the plans for the tower were apparently shelved during the campaign, Mr. Trump and the Agalarovs maintained their friendship. In June 2016, a publicist for Emin Agalarov requested that Donald Trump Jr. meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That meeting, at Trump Tower in New York, first reported by The New York Times last July, included other campaign officials and has been the subject of considerable scrutiny. After the disclosure of the meeting, the president downplayed his ties to the Agalarovs in an interview with The Times. But in a September 2015 interview on ‚ÄúThe Hugh Hewitt Show,‚Äù he had made the Miss Universe pageant seem far more important. ‚ÄúI called it my weekend in Moscow,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. ‚ÄúI was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can‚Äôt go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.‚Äù Two decades ago, Mr. Trump was a persona non grata on Wall Street. His casino and hotel businesses had suffered some bankruptcies, and his lenders were grumbling that he had stiffed them. But one giant German bank stepped up as a willing partner. Over the years, that institution, Deutsche Bank, offered Mr. Trump more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, The Times reported last year.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. There is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump‚Äôs loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, and there is no public evidence that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed the bank for records about Mr. Trump. But the bank last year landed in legal trouble over Russian money laundering ‚Äî paying more than $600 million in penalties to American and British regulators. Advertisement Some Deutsche Bank executives expect they will eventually have to produce records as part of Mr. Mueller‚Äôs inquiry, The Times  reported last July. The bank has already been asked to turn over documents to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn about another client with a White House connection: the Kushner Companies, the family business of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law and adviser. Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian billionaire oligarch, paid $95 million for Mr. Trump‚Äôs oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., one of two sources of income from Russians that Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyers have said were reflected in his income tax returns. (The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.) The Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons. Mr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem. Mr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property. At the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower. The Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev‚Äôs divorce. Mr. Rybolovlev‚Äôs wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied. He has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities. A spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market. The spokesman also said that the property was acquired by a family trust ‚Äúspecifically and explicitly for investment purposes,‚Äù and that depending on the sale price of the final lot, the investment might ‚Äúend up yielding a decent return.‚Äù In the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery. A respected golf writer says that Eric Trump, a son of Mr. Trump‚Äôs who is now helping to run the Trump Organization, told him the money came from Russia. Advertisement Last year, during an interview on Boston public radio, the golf journalist James Dodson recounted a conversation he had had with Eric Trump in 2013 on a newly opened Trump golf course in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Dodson said he had asked Mr. Trump about the company‚Äôs sources of funds, and Mr. Trump told him, ‚ÄúWe have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.‚Äù Eric Trump has denied making the comment about Russia, but several of Mr. Dodson‚Äôs friends and colleagues confirmed that Mr. Dodson relayed the anecdote to them shortly after the conversation took place. It was not the first time that one of Mr. Trump‚Äôs sons made a similar claim. In 2008, at a real estate conference in New York, Donald Trump Jr. said: ‚ÄúIn terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2018, on Page A23 of the New York edition with the headline: Mueller Wants Trump‚Äôs Business Files.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Richard C. Paddock PATTAYA, Thailand ‚Äî It has all the makings of a pulp novel, though the ending is still a mystery. A high-end escort from Belarus, who says she was the mistress of a powerful Russian oligarch, flees to Thailand. But at a seaside resort known for its raunchy entertainment scene, she gets arrested for helping to conduct a sex workshop. Hoping to avoid deportation, she offers information about President Trump and Russia. But her appeal is for naught. No one has stepped forward to grant her asylum. Such has been the saga this week of Anastasia Vashukevich, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka. The 21-year-old model and blogger was arrested Sunday in the Thai holiday town of Pattaya along with nine others involved in the sex training course, which was aimed at male Russian tourists. ‚ÄúShe will be deported,‚Äù said the chief of Thailand‚Äôs Immigration Bureau, Suttipong Wongpin, in an interview Thursday. ‚ÄúHer immigration offense is working without a work permit.‚Äù In events that have played out publicly on Instagram and YouTube for months, Ms. Vashukevich has revealed what she says was her close association with the aluminum tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska and his friendship with Russia‚Äôs powerful deputy prime minister, Sergei E. Prikhodko. Mr. Deripaska has business ties to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump‚Äôs former campaign chairman, who is under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into the campaign‚Äôs connections to Russia. Financial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir V. Putin. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort offered to give Mr. Deripaska private briefings. Ms. Vashukevich, in a video that she apparently recorded in the back of a Thai police truck after her arrest, said she could provide evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. She claims to have detailed information about connections between Russian officials, Mr. Manafort and Mr. Trump ‚Äî if only someone could get her out of Thai detention. Her assertion of inside knowledge might be easily dismissed but for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month on YouTube by the Russian opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, which relies heavily on videos and photos from Ms. Vashukevich. In particular, it includes video footage from 2016 of Mr. Deripaska sailing on his yacht with Mr. Prikhodko and a description of their meeting in a book by Ms. Vashukevich. Mr. Navalny asserted that the yacht trip was a bribe from Mr. Deripaska to Mr. Prikhodko and said that Ms. Vashukevich was one of ‚Äúseveral‚Äù prostitutes aboard the vessel. In one part of the video, the two men can be heard discussing Russian-American relations. The video has had more than 6.2 million views despite efforts in Russia to block it. Mr. Deripaska said through a spokesman that Mr. Navalny‚Äôs allegations of bribery and prostitutes were a ‚Äúhot story that appears far from being the truth.‚Äù In a last-ditch effort to prevent Ms. Vashukevich‚Äôs deportation from Thailand, her associate Alexander Kirillov, also known as Alex Lesley, distributed a letter addressed to ‚ÄúUSA Consul‚Äù seeking political asylum for all 10 of the arrested sex workshop trainers. Mr. Kirillov, who was alleged to be running the sex seminar, was in immigration detention after being arrested. The letter claims that their lives are at risk and reiterates the offer of inside information about communications between the oligarch, the deputy prime minister and people in the United States. ‚ÄúHelp us and protect us as quickly as possible because we have very important information for USA,‚Äù the letter says. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Bangkok declined to comment. Mr. Suttipong, a police lieutenant general, said that Ms. Vashukevich remained in detention. He said that her visa was revoked after she was found to be working in Pattaya, about 80 miles south of Bangkok. Five others arrested in connection with their roles in the sex training will also be deported, he said, and the other four will remain in Thailand, where they may face criminal charges. Videos of the workshop posted by the organizers showed dozens of men, and a few women, sitting in rows of chairs in a hotel meeting room while listening to lectures in Russian. Hotel staff called the police when they heard suspicious noises coming from the room, according to local media reports. At one point, Ms. Vashukevich posted a photo of herself in what appears to be a jail cell. In an Instagram post on Wednesday afternoon, she said she was being taken to the main immigration detention center in Bangkok. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being transported to another prison again,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúTo Bangkok.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters WASHINGTON ‚Äî Members of the Trump administration's seven-man delegation to Beijing for talks to try to stave off a trade war between the world's two largest economies have widely divergent views on trade policy and tariffs, which may make it difficult for them to speak with one voice. The players are seen as likely to give President Donald Trump their individual views on any trade offers from Chinese officials, letting him decide whether to accept them or push ahead with tariffs. Here is a description of the U.S. team.  STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY  Mnuchin, a former banker, Hollywood film financier and Trump campaign finance manager, holds the top cabinet post overseeing economic and financial regulatory policy. The ex-Goldman Sachs executive was once viewed as one of the administration's ""globalists"" allied with former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn in opposition to tariffs. But in recent months, he has voiced strong support for Trump's tougher trade approach to China and steel and aluminum tariffs. The Treasury is now developing U.S. investment restrictions on Chinese companies.  ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE Lighthizer served as a deputy USTR in the 1980s, using tariff threats to win voluntary export restraints from Japan on autos and steel, earning a reputation as a tough negotiator. The Washington trade lawyer has long expressed views that China has failed to live up to obligations that came with joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. He led USTR's ""Section 301"" intellectual property study alleging that China misappropriated U.S. technology, resulting in threatened tariffs on up to $150 billion in Chinese goods. Lighthizer said this week that changing the U.S. relationship with China is ""a big, big challenge"" that would play out over years.  PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE AND MANUFACTURING ADVISER  Navarro, a former economics professor at the University of California-Irvine, won notoriety for his controversial book and film, ""Death by China."" He holds the most hawkish views on Chinese trade policy, and is seen as likely to oppose a short-term agreement that does little to change the course of China's industrial policy. He recently argued on Fox Business Network that the tariffs are designed to compensate the United States for ""robbing our technology blind,"" adding: ""If you allow China to basically capture the industries of the future, we won't have a future.""  LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC POLICY ADVISER Kudlow is best known as CNBC television's longtime conservative markets and economics commentator, who replaced Gary Cohn as the head of the National Economic Council. Like Cohn, Kudlow has long been an advocate for free markets and trade, and had frequently criticized Trump's tariff approach. But since taking the job he has referred to tariffs as a negotiating tactic aimed at achieving fairer trade relationships. Kudlow also has acted to calm uneasy markets by telling White House cameras that a trade war has not started and the tariffs may not take effect. WILBUR ROSS, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY Ross, the 80-year-old billionaire investor and steel executive, has been a strong advocate of tariffs to level the playing field for U.S. companies. At Commerce, he heads the administration's stepped up anti-dumping enforcement efforts and presided over global steel and aluminum tariffs enacted in March. But Ross' influence in trade policy has waned somewhat after Trump rejected a deal that Ross had arranged last July during the last major U.S.-China economic dialogue in Washington.  EVERETT EISSENSTAT, DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY Eissenstat serves as the ""sherpa"" negotiating on behalf of the United States at major international economic gatherings such as the G20 and G7 summits. A long-time trade hand who once worked at USTR, he was most recently the chief trade lawyer for the Senate Finance Committee, where he helped pass the 2015 ""fast track"" trade negotiating authority legislation. Eissenstat briefed reporters on Trump's first $50 billion in tariffs, saying that China had used technology transfers from U.S. companies ""to establish its own competitive advantage in an unfair manner."" TERRY BRANSTAD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA Former Iowa governor Branstad brings to the talks a longstanding relationship with China and a strong perspective on agriculture -- a U.S. sector vulnerable to China's threatened tariff retaliation. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who first met Branstad in 1985 on an agricultural mission to Iowa, has described the ex-governor as ""old friend of China"" after decades of farm commodities trade. But Branstad has vowed to support Trump's tougher approach to China on trade issues.   (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper, Oleg Matsnev and Ana Vanessa Herrero SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctions. Both governments, with ambitions to create state-sponsored cryptocurrencies, are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system: a new kind of money and financial infrastructure, outside the control of any central authority, particularly the United States. The Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish, even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors. But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructure. What has seemed like a fringe concept is starting to gain some level of acceptance in global finance. Several of the largest central banks in the world, including the Bank of England and the People‚Äôs Bank of China, have said they are looking at using the technology introduced by Bitcoin to track and issue their own digital currencies. In Venezuela, the idea has come from the top. President Nicol√°s Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro, which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the government‚Äôs oil and natural resources. In Russia, officials under President Vladimir V. Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoin-like crypto ruble. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to state-sensitive types of activities, this instrument suits us very well,‚Äù one of Mr. Putin‚Äôs aides, Sergei Glazyev, said last month in a conversation about the crypto ruble, according to several Russian news outlets. ‚ÄúWe can settle payments with our business partners all over the world regardless of sanctions.‚Äù Economists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuela‚Äôs Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate. That‚Äôs because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge, while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currencies. That runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currency. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain, which is maintained by many independent computers. The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions. Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service, the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authority. That would provide a good way to get around sanctions, which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rules. But some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hacking. In a speech last year, a member of the German central bank‚Äôs executive board, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, said the bank‚Äôs ‚Äúconceptual study shows that blockchain technology can be adapted to meet the current needs and requirements of the financial system.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe prototype works,‚Äù he added. These projects, though, have been slow to move from prototype to working systems, and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcome. None of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can control. Mr. Maduro introduced the idea on Dec. 3 in his regular Sunday television program. He said he had been monitoring so-called cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro, which would be backed by the country‚Äôs gold, oil, gas and diamond reserves. ‚ÄúTo overcome the financial blockade, this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing,‚Äù he said. Since then, the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operation. The Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses, but will derive their value from the government‚Äôs natural resources. The link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago. The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency, the bol√≠var, has experienced in recent years because of the government‚Äôs unbridled expansion of the money supply. The boldness of the Petro plan is in proportion to Venezuela‚Äôs desperate economic condition, which has officials looking for anything that could help. ‚ÄúThe country is in a social crisis,‚Äù said Jos√© √Ångel √Ålvarez, the head of a national association, Asonacrip, that has been working with the government on the Petro. ‚ÄúHow do we manage to build trust? Open technology, clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin: decentralization, for example.‚Äù Mr. √Ålvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018. But the link between the currency and the government‚Äôs oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors, given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr. Maduros‚Äôs government. There is a measure of irony in the government‚Äôs interest in cryptocurrencies. Over the last few years, Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr. Maduro‚Äôs government. An online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bol√≠var, which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation. This year, the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold, according to Chainalysis, a data analysis firm. The Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activity. Randy Brito, the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela, said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities ‚Äî more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until now. In most cases, buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela. That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the country. Mr. Brito, who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain, said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial system. ‚ÄúThe irony is in front of us,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have been blockaded by the U.S., just like they blockade their own people from operating.‚Äù The Russian government has also not looked kindly upon its citizens‚Äô use of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. While the government‚Äôs policies have remained opaque, officials with the Russian Central Bank have talked about blocking the access of people inside the country to virtual currency websites, and Mr. Putin has pointed out the many potential illegal uses of the technology. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains, tax evasion and even financing of terrorism, not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim,‚Äù he said in October. But Mr. Putin has indicated that he is open to potential uses of the technology that would be under his control. In June, he had a much publicized conversation with Vitalik Buterin, the creator of one of the largest virtual currency networks, Ethereum. Mr. Buterin was raised in Canada and has dual Russian and Canadian citizenship. A number of officials with the central bank and the Ministry of Communication have dropped hints about the creation of some sort of crypto ruble. The efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better. But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctions. The Russian minister of communications, Nikolai Nikiforov, said in October that a crypto ruble would be designed quite differently from Bitcoin, with no need for the mining process through which Bitcoins are released into the world. Such a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions, which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as well. The authorities in the United States have long been aware that virtual currencies might be used to evade sanctions. David S. Cohen, a Treasury official focused on terrorism and financial intelligence, said in 2014 that the American authorities were not seeing any widespread efforts to get around sanctions with virtual currencies. But, he said at the time, ‚Äúthese are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer value.‚Äù Nathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco, Oleg Matsnev from Moscow, and Ana Vanessa Herrero from Caracas, Venezuela.

Now Zynga, a once high-flying maker of popular internet games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends, has taken the unusual step of scrapping its founder-friendly structure ‚Äî a change that could make it easier for the company to sell itself down the line. The founder-empowered structure at the heart of many tech companies is known as a multiclass stock structure, under which those who started the company own a certain class of stock that gives them outsize voting power even after it goes public. At Zynga, Mark Pincus, the company‚Äôs founder, has now converted some of his shares that carry more voting clout ‚Äî known as Class B and C shares ‚Äî into common Class A shares. The conversion reduces his overall voting power at Zynga to about 10 percent from about 70 percent. Mr. Pincus will not see any change in his economic interest in the company from the conversion. The change comes as Mr. Pincus and his wife, Alison Gelb Pincus, are going through a divorce. Last year, publications in San Francisco, where Zynga is based, speculated that the divorce could jeopardize his control over Zynga. Ms. Pincus is challenging a prenuptial agreement with her husband, according to a document filed in California Superior Court. An attorney for Ms. Pincus did not respond to a request for comment. In a phone interview, Mr. Pincus said his divorce, which he described as amicable, was ‚Äúnot part of or relevant to the announcement‚Äù of his conversion of his stock. Rather, Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga‚Äôs board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee ‚Äî he was executive chairman ‚Äî and become nonexecutive chairman of the company‚Äôs board of directors. ‚ÄúWe think the company doesn‚Äôt benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,‚Äù Mr. Pincus said. Dual-class voting structures have been around for decades and have been especially popular at media companies, such as News Corporation and The New York Times Company. Many prominent tech companies have turned to them as well, starting with the initial public offering of Google in 2004. Since then, Facebook, Zynga, Snap and a variety of others have followed suit with similar structures. As a result, shareholder meetings for some of the world‚Äôs most valuable companies ‚Äî including Facebook and Alphabet, the holding company that now owns Google ‚Äî are mostly for show. Shareholders propose and vote on resolutions even though the founders have the only votes that matter. The vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors. Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite an unusual move, but it‚Äôs a welcome move,‚Äù Mr. Elson said. Multiclass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. ‚ÄúIf a C.E.O. does a poor job, he‚Äôs not going to fire himself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.‚Äù Some recent studies, however, have suggested that companies with multiclass structures have outperformed companies with a single stock class. A report last month by the lawyer David Berger and Prof. Laurie Simon Hodrick of Columbia Business School concluded that there are benefits to multiclass structures, including limiting pressure from institutional investors, which own the majority of public shares. The authors said that calls to limit multiclass structures were premature. In response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision. Mr. Pincus said Zynga‚Äôs multiclass share structure provided his company with ‚Äúair cover‚Äù during several difficult years after it went public at the end of 2011. The company originally made games that people played on Facebook through desktop web browsers, but its business was upended by the surge of mobile gaming on smartphones. Zynga gradually focused on mobile games, but its stock has languished even as it has mounted a turnaround under a new chief executive, Frank Gibeau. The company‚Äôs shares closed at $3.64 on Wednesday, far below the $10 public offering price. Zynga also announced it had swung to a profit of $5.6 million in the first quarter from a loss of $9.5 million a year ago. Mr. Pincus said his voting control at Zynga had not given him veto power over outside offers to acquire the company, though it did give him the ability to replace board members. He said he had never exercised that right. When asked if Zynga could consider acquisition offers more easily now that Mr. Pincus had relinquished most of his voting power, Mr. Gibeau said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not our mission ‚Äî our focus is to grow the company.‚Äù Mr. Pincus said he intended to devote more time to investing in start-ups. He said he was particularly interested in companies focused on the blockchain, the technology that‚Äôs behind electronic currencies like Bitcoin, but could also have broader applications. Giving up his control of Zynga, Mr. Pincus said, will ‚Äúcreate more space between me and the company whenever I go launch new products.‚Äù Follow Nick Wingfield and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @nickwingfield and @jacknicas.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Warriors 129, Cavaliers 120 By Scott Cacciola OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî The Golden State Warriors will forever be known as one of the most talented teams in the history of the N.B.A., along with a hefty set of other superlatives: most dominant, most dazzling, most adept at hitting shots from distant galaxies. But for all their astonishing skill, the Warriors were determined, too. Determined to make amends for last season. Determined to escape the clutches of LeBron James. And determined to restore themselves as champions. On Monday night, before an exultant crowd at Oracle Arena, where gold confetti fluttered from the ceiling at the final buzzer, the Warriors put the last dab of polish on a gilded season by surging to their second championship in three years with a 129-120 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals. Golden State won the best-of-seven series by four games to one, capping a commanding postseason run. The Warriors went 16-1, their lone loss coming to the Cavaliers in Game 4, and largely turned a succession of high-powered opponents into stage props. It was the basketball equivalent of lapping the field. After two lopsided losses, the Cavaliers at least made the series competitive and highly entertaining. But the Warriors‚Äô star power ‚Äî including Kevin Durant, whom they signed last summer for expressly this pressure-cooker purpose ‚Äî prevailed over James, Kyrie Irving and the rest of the Cavaliers. ‚ÄúIt feels amazing to win a championship with these guys,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to celebrate for the rest of the night ‚Äî well, maybe the rest of the summer.‚Äù On Monday, Durant was at his long-limbed best, doing his part to snuff every rally that the Cavaliers could muster. He scored 39 points and was named the series‚Äô most valuable player. With about 55 seconds left, Durant could sense that he was getting lost in the moment. ‚ÄúIs this really happening?‚Äù he recalled asking himself. Stephen Curry had 34 points and 10 assists in the win. The Warriors also got a huge game from Andre Iguodala, who scored 20 points off the bench in addition to defending James for long stretches. James delivered the Full LeBron: 41 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists, a typical postseason effort for him. Irving scored 26 points, and J. R. Smith added 25. ‚ÄúI have no reason to look back at what I could have done or what I should have done or what I could have done better for the team,‚Äù said James, who averaged a triple-double during the series ‚Äî 33.6 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. ‚ÄúI left everything I had out on the floor every single game for five games in these finals, and you come up short.‚Äù The teams were coming off two tightly contested games in Cleveland, where the Cavaliers had salvaged some hope. On Monday, the Warriors took an 11-point lead into the second half. After the Cavaliers cut it to 4 late in the third quarter, Durant connected on a 3-pointer, and the crowd seemed to exhale. The Warriors maintained their cushion in the fourth. After the Cavaliers‚Äô Kyle Korver made a 3-pointer, Durant got inside for a dunk. Curry followed that by whipping a pass to Iguodala for another slam, and the Warriors were up by 10. Inside the building, cautious optimism gave way to full-blown jubilation as the final minutes ticked away. ‚ÄúWinning a championship is so hard,‚Äù Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. ‚ÄúAnd when you do it, you just get nine months of all this work and you can finally let loose.‚Äù This was the third straight finals meeting between the Warriors and the Cavaliers. After Golden State won in 2015, Cleveland put together an unprecedented comeback to take the championship last season. That series, which went a full seven games, was packed with drama and ended with James leading the Cavaliers to their first title in franchise history. It was a deflating end for the Warriors, who had set a record by winning 73 games in the regular season. But they regrouped last summer by luring Durant away from the Oklahoma City Thunder in free agency. Kerr and his All-Star cast met with Durant in the Hamptons on Long Island and sold him on a delicious future: the chance to win multiple titles, to be a key cog on a forever team. The addition of Durant was not universally celebrated. Durant was accused by some of pursuing the easiest path to a championship. The Warriors, too, were criticized for somehow becoming too good, for creating a parity problem ‚Äî as if they should have passed on the chance to sign Durant out of concern for the good of the league. It was a curious argument ‚Äî teams generally do whatever they can to win ‚Äî and the Warriors, with Durant in the mix, treated their regular-season opponents like roadkill. They stuck to that script through the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Warriors swept the Portland Trail Blazers, the Utah Jazz and the San Antonio Spurs. If the Warriors got some breaks ‚Äî Kawhi Leonard, the Spurs‚Äô best player, missed the last three games of the Western Conference finals with a sprained ankle ‚Äî they dealt with adversity, too. In the first round, Kerr stepped away from his day-to-day duties to seek treatment for complications stemming from back surgery. Without him on the bench, the Warriors won 11 straight games under Mike Brown ‚Äî an assistant who became the acting head coach ‚Äî including the finals opener against Cleveland. Kerr returned for Game 2, and the team kept humming. As their series against the Cavaliers wore on, the Warriors found themselves fending off more than just the Cavaliers. Several former N.B.A. stars piped up to make the case that their old teams could have beaten the Warriors. Among them: Magic Johnson, who contended that the Los Angeles Lakers of the Showtime era would have swept Golden State. Kerr, in turn, brushed those comments aside. ‚ÄúThey would all kill us,‚Äù Kerr said, deadpan, last week. ‚ÄúThe game gets worse as time goes on. Players are less talented than they used to be. The guys in the ‚Äô50s would‚Äôve destroyed everybody. It‚Äôs weird how human evolution goes in reverse in sports. Players get weaker, smaller, less skilled. I don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt explain it.‚Äù For Game 5, the Cavaliers broke out their black ‚Äúshirseys,‚Äù the same uniforms they had worn here for their greatest triumph: Game 7 of last year‚Äôs finals. And they played fearless basketball once again, sinking six of their first seven field-goal attempts. They led by as many as 8 in the first quarter. But the Warriors rallied, scoring 15 straight points to take a 54-43 lead in the second quarter. Durant, who was exceptional in the first half, scoring 21 points while shooting 7 of 10 from the field, made a 3-pointer to push the lead to 15. The first half also featured a few extracurriculars, including a scuffle that starred the Warriors‚Äô David West. Golden State took a 71-60 lead into halftime. The Warriors, despite their mass of individual talent, were a true collaboration. Consider their willingness to pass the ball in the finals: 147 assists on 216 field goals. The Cavaliers, who leaned so heavily on James and Irving, had just 108 assists on 208 field goals. Durant, of course, gave his new team the biggest assist of all.

Sports,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMAY 2, 2018, 6:52 P.M. E.D.T.  Injuries are having a major impact on the NBA playoffs. A tweak, turn or strain to this or that has sidelined or limited players from All-Stars to reserves ‚Äî and that has influenced the early outcomes of Round 2. After Jaylen Brown strained his right hamstring in Boston's Game 7 win over Milwaukee, he all but begged the Celtics doctors and trainers to let him suit up for the start of their Eastern Conference semifinal matchup with Philadelphia. Boston managed to win without him in its 117-101 victory over the sluggish 76ers in Game 1 Monday night, thanks to career nights by Al Horford, Terry Rozier and rookie Jayson Tatum. But despite two days or rest and treatment, coach Brad Stevens said Brown is ""very doubtful"" for Game 2 on Thursday night. Advertisement ""The bottom line is with this hamstring injury is it's not terrible. Not a long-term thing. It shouldn't linger if he comes back at the right time,"" Stevens said. Advertisement If Brown can't go for Game 2, it will again put stress on a Celtics rotation that just recently got back Marcus Smart from a right thumb surgery. Fred VanVleet appeared to tweak his right shoulder in the second half of the Raptors' 113-112 overtime loss to Cleveland in Game 1 of their series Tuesday night. He missed most of Toronto's first-round series against Washington with shoulder problems, but the Raptors still turned to him with the game on the line against the Cavaliers. VanVleet missed what would have been a go-ahead 3-pointer in the waning moments of regulation and another in the extra frame. ""I wish I wasn't hurt,"" he said, ""but I'm not looking for any excuses."" Elsewhere in the league, the return of some players and absence of others has been just as noticeable. Stephen Curry, who sat out all of Golden State's first-round series win over San Antonio with a sprained ligament in his left knee, gave the Warriors a major lift in his return for Game 2 of the Golden State's semifinal matchup with the Pelicans on Tuesday night. Ricky Rubio missed the Jazz's series-opening loss against Houston on Sunday with a left hamstring injury and is out indefinitely. The Rockets' Luc Mbah a Moute returned in Game 1 from the dislocated right shoulder he sustained last month. Houston originally thought he's be out a full month, but he came back ahead of schedule and didn't show any lingering effects from the injury in 21 minutes of action. A closer look at Thursday's games: CAVALIERS AT RAPTORS Cavaliers lead 1-0. Game 2, 6 p.m. EDT, ESPN. NEED TO KNOW: The Raptors have lost seven straight playoff games against the Cavaliers, dating to the 2016 Eastern Conference finals, and blew a chance to take a lead in the series by coughing up a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter of Game 1 . The Raptors missed four potential game-winning shots at the end of regulation, and a wide-open 3 by VanVleet late in overtime.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He had 21 points and 21 rebounds in Game 1 and shot 7 for 19, but missed five of six attempts in the fourth. On Wednesday, Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said he can live with Valanciunas getting looks in the post if it means fewer touches for Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, and fewer 3-point attempts by the Raptors. INJURY UPDATE: While VanVleet acknowledged he's still dealing with discomfort in his shoulder, he plans to play through it for now. Advertisement PRESSURE IS ON: The Raptors. The top-seeded team in the East has already surrendered home court advantage to its playoff nemesis and is 0-5 all-time on the road against Cleveland in the postseason. If Toronto can't even this series before it shifts to Ohio, it might not be coming back across the border for Game 5. 76ERS AT CELTICS Celtics lead 1-0. Game 2, 8:30 p.m. EDT, TNT. NEED TO KNOW: The Celtics negated the athleticism of the 76ers in Game 1 by knocking down 17 3-pointers. Before the big scoring nights by Rozier (29 points), Tatum (28 points) and Horford (26 points), the Celtics hadn't had three players score 25 or more points in a playoff game since 2009. KEEP AN EYE ON: 76ers C Joel Embiid. He had 31 points and 12 rebounds in Game 1, becoming the first Philadelphia player to register 30 points and 10 rebounds in a playoff game since Allen Iverson in 2001. But he said the focus will be on defense in Game 2. ""We didn't stick to the game plan,"" he said. ""There's a lot of stuff we can definitely correct."" INJURY UPDATE: Smart said Wednesday that his thumb remained ""a little sore"" after Game 1 but added ""I'm good to go"" for Game 2. PRESSURE IS ON: The 76ers. They entered the series on six days of rest but were doomed by a slow start in Game 1. This young group mostly cruised over the final three games last series against Miami. Being down 0-2 with its home court to defend is a lot to ask against a Celtics team playing with a lot of confidence. ___ AP Freelance Writer Ian Harrison contributed to this report from Toronto. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball ___ We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page.

Sports,"Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAJUNE 4, 2017  OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî After a six-week absence, Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, was back on the bench at Oracle Arena on Sunday for Game 2 of the N.B.A. finals. When his face appeared on the arena‚Äôs giant video boards a few minutes before the opening tipoff, the crowd stood and roared. Kerr had been on an indefinite leave as he again sought treatment for chronic pain, stemming from what he has described as botched back surgery. But before Sunday‚Äôs game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Kerr said that he felt well enough to return to the bench and that he intended to coach the Warriors for the remainder of the finals. ‚ÄúI wanted to string together a few good days,‚Äù he said before Game 2, which the Warriors won, 132-113. ‚ÄúI did that.‚Äù Dressed in team sweats and sounding upbeat, Kerr made the announcement at a news conference about two hours before the game. He said he had not had a chance to inform his players of his decision. But he suspected that they already knew. Advertisement ‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre all on their phones all the time,‚Äù Kerr said. Kerr stepped away from his day-to-day duties with the team in late April after the Warriors won the first two games of their first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers. Advertisement At the time, Kerr said he still had pain ‚Äî including headaches ‚Äî from complications connected to his surgery in 2015. On May 5, Kerr had a procedure at Duke University to repair a spinal fluid leak. Since then, he had been working with the team at practice and in the locker room but had not felt well enough to coach from the bench. He left those duties to Mike Brown, an assistant who became the team‚Äôs acting head coach in Kerr‚Äôs absence. Under Brown, the Warriors won all 11 of their games ‚Äî including Thursday‚Äôs finals opener against the Cavaliers. With a deadpan delivery, Kerr said the team had clearly been ‚Äúfalling apart at the seams‚Äù as he watched from afar. In truth, the Warriors continued to play their familiar brand of high-octane basketball. Brown had said that he was merely a placeholder until Kerr felt able to return. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs perfect as my right-hand man,‚Äù Kerr said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs such a good coach and a good person. And the way he‚Äôs handled this whole thing is incredible ‚Äî just the humility and yet the confidence with which he took the reins. Players appreciate him; the staff does; I certainly do.

I don‚Äôt know why things got worse. But since that time ‚Äî and it‚Äôs probably been five, six weeks ‚Äî I‚Äôve gotten a lot better, and I feel like I‚Äôm back to the baseline of where I was during the regular season, when I coached every game.‚Äù Advertisement Cleveland Coach Tyronn Lue said he had been texting with Kerr in recent weeks. ‚ÄúSteve Kerr‚Äôs a guy I respected even before he started coaching,‚Äù Lue said before the game. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs good to have him back over there.‚Äù Kerr has guided the Warriors to the N.B.A. finals in each of his three seasons as the head coach, and they won the championship two years ago. He missed more than half of last season after a back operation and a follow-up procedure. He returned to the bench to help steer the Warriors to a league-record 73 regular-season wins before they lost to the Cavaliers in the finals. On Sunday, Kerr joked that he would break out an inspirational speech ‚Äî something along the lines of ‚Äúwin one for the Gipper‚Äù ‚Äî in the locker room before the game. ‚ÄúMaybe get a little teary-eyed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúImplore them to win it for me, because it‚Äôs not important for them to win it for themselves.‚Äù Of course, he did none of that. ‚ÄúNothing really changes for our players,‚Äù Kerr said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing the same stuff, and the strategy remains the same.

Sports,"Advertisement By VICTOR MATHERMAY 26, 2017  So, for the third straight season, the Warriors and the Cavaliers are facing off in the N.B.A. finals. Though many saw this matchup as inevitable, it‚Äôs a historical anomaly. While there have been dynasties before in the N.B.A., it‚Äôs rare for two of them to line up so closely. The finals have never before matched the same teams three years in a row. Injuries, aging, loss of form and sheer randomness always seemed to get in the way. Even in the dominant Celtics-Lakers eras, the same teams never met in the finals three times in a row. The Celtics reached 10 straight finals in the ‚Äô50s and ‚Äô60s (winning nine of them). Nine of those were against the St. Louis Hawks or the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. But never three consecutively. The Lakers or the Celtics were in every finals of the ‚Äô80s. But the 76ers, the Rockets or the Pistons always jumped in to prevent their pairing three times in a row. Advertisement Indeed, the triple rematch is a rarity in any team sport. Among the competitions in which it has never happened are the W.N.B.A. finals, the M.L.S. Cup, the Final Four (men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs) and the F.A. Cup. Advertisement There have been three significant instances of the phenomenon, one each in professional baseball, football and hockey. In the early 1920s, New York was the epicenter of baseball greatness, and the Giants and Yankees faced off in the World Series in 1921, ‚Äô22 and ‚Äô23.                  With 35 points against the Celtics on Thursday night LeBron James now has the most career playoff points. He passed Michael Jordan, who held the record since 1998.             You could not even call the first two of them ‚ÄúSubway Series,‚Äù as no subway was needed for travel between games: The teams played in the same park, the Polo Grounds. In 1921, The New York Times was bold enough to declare: ‚ÄúYankees‚Äô Batting Should Win Series.‚Äù Babe Ruth did hit .313, despite being hampered by an arm injury. But the Giants won the best-of-nine series, five games to three. Noting the one time that the Cubs and White Sox had faced each other in the World Series, The Times crowed about the Giants-Yankees rematch the next year under the boldly declarative headline ‚ÄúNew York Now Has Edge on Chicago.‚Äù The Giants won again, taking a best-of-seven series four games to none with one tie, with Ruth hitting just .118. ‚ÄúThey are still champions of the universe, and a better team of champions never won the highest honors of the game,‚Äù The Times wrote. Heinie Groh and Frankie Frisch both hit over .470. In 1923, with the Yankees in their new stadium, the series was seen as a tossup. But the Yankees turned the tables and won, four games to two, with Ruth having a monumental series, hitting .368 with three homers. The eighth inning of the last game, in which the Yankees scored five runs to take the lead, was likened by the immortal Grantland Rice to ‚Äúthe fall of Rome, the destruction of Carthage, the feast of Belshazzar, the rout of Cyrus, the wreck of the Hesperus and the Chicago fire.‚Äù Advertisement The Giants were back for a fourth time the next year, but their opponents were the Washington Senators, making a rare appearance after finishing two games ahead of the Yankees in the American League. The N.F.L.‚Äôs triple match was between two teams no one is expecting to return to the big game soon: the Lions and the Browns, from 1952 to 1954. In the days before neutral site Super Bowls, the Lions had to travel to Cleveland in 1952, but came away with the win, 17-7, behind stars like Bobby Layne and Doak Walker. They did it again in Detroit the next year, 17-16, despite three field goals by the Browns‚Äô Lou Groza. But in 1954, Cleveland blew them out, 56-10, intercepting Layne six times. It was ‚Äúcrushing and humiliating,‚Äù wrote The Times. The Browns were back the next year, but the victims were the Los Angeles Rams. The Lions sank to 3-9. In the N.H.L., the Canadiens and Red Wings met in 1954, ‚Äô55 and ‚Äô56. This could hardly have been a surprise to hockey fans: One or both of the teams had been in every Stanley Cup finals for 13 years. The ‚Äô54 and ‚Äô55 finals were hard fought, with Detroit winning each in seven games. In 1954, the series was decided by an overtime goal by Tony Leswick. It remains the last time a Game 7 in a finals went into overtime. In 1956, the Canadiens had their revenge, winning in a relatively comfortable five games. Jean B√©liveau had seven goals in the series. In an era when the league had only six teams, returning to the finals was easier than it is today, and the Wings and Canadiens had the two best records the next year. But Detroit was surprised by Boston in the semifinals. Other trilogies in major team finals can be found, but they are few and far between. In the Euroleague basketball tournament, Real Madrid and Varese met from 1974-76. In the Frozen Four, the finalists were Michigan Tech and Minnesota from 1974-76. Now the Cavaliers and Warriors join them. A lot can happen in a year. But given their dominance, no one is betting against a staggering fourpeat in 2018.

Sports,"Advertisement    Michael Powell     SPORTS OF THE TIMES JUNE 4, 2017  The Golden State Warriors are the N.B.A.‚Äôs driverless car. Their coach in Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals, who may or may not be their coach in Game 2, was Mike Brown, an assistant who twice coached their opponent. Their coach for more than half of last season was an assistant, Luke Walton, who later moved 370 miles to the south to oversee the pre-K experience that is the Los Angeles Lakers. The team‚Äôs putative, on-paper head coach is Steve Kerr, who conceived this let‚Äôs-have-fun team. He missed more than half of last season and almost all of this year‚Äôs playoffs as he has dealt with the aftermath of back surgery in 2015. And now Kerr has returned for Game 2. As Kerr is the first to acknowledge, none of these entrances and exits seem to make a whit of difference to the graceful raptor that is the Warriors. They‚Äôve won every game in this postseason. And in Game 1 of the finals, they planted tire tracks on the backs of the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers. They also won almost all of their games last year when Kerr was at the helm (save for the finals, when the LeBronettes made one of the more improbable comebacks in finals history). And of course, the Kerr-led team won the championship the year before that. It‚Äôs enough to make me wonder if coaches are all that important. If I had a modicum of true basketball knowledge and I was bequeathed Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and the spindly and graceful 7-foot force that is Kevin Durant, not to mention a host of smart role players, perhaps I could close my eyes and wake up in the N.B.A. finals. Advertisement Let me pause here and apologize. Mine is absurd self-delusion, the result of spending too much time in my hometown, New York City, watching Mr. 11-Rings, Phil Jackson, make a fool of himself as president of the former professional basketball team known as the Knicks. You want to argue again that his ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù success owes more than a bit to having the good fortune to coach first Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, and then Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal? I‚Äôm all ears. Back in the N.B.A., the success of the Warriors and the Cavaliers owes to cooperative evolution, as players and coaches and general managers work as co-producers. In Cleveland, LeBron James takes guff for playing maestro, but it‚Äôs difficult to look at the team, with its core of James, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving and a bench loaded with midseason pickups like Kyle Korver and Deron Williams, and not give him his due. Advertisement The Warriors take the co-producer approach and cube it. Kerr, in announcing his return on Sunday, played with this. Asked to evaluate Brown, he put on a mock frown. ‚ÄúI just think the numbers are totally deceiving,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can talk like 15-0 or whatever he did, but the team was just falling apart at the seams.‚Äù The day before, Durant sat on the dais after practice and talked of culture shock upon joining the Warriors last summer. As he describes it, the team is akin to a hip start-up, all free sandwiches and Kale-and-turmeric shakes, with yoga classes and Flying Lotus on the speakers. The players do their own thing as music blasts, working on footwork and Pilates and dekes and shots ‚Äî in sync, but not in uniformity. ‚ÄúI remember the first few practices, me and Mike, we were the new guys and we were looking at each other like: ‚ÄòThis is how it goes down here‚Äô?‚Äù Durant said of those early days when he and Brown were settling in. ‚ÄúSometimes in games, we don‚Äôt run a play for two or three minutes straight. And I‚Äôm, like, ‚ÄòMan, I‚Äôm so used to making sure we run something every time down.‚Äô‚Äù Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

Let‚Äôs turn now to Brown. To watch him joking with reporters about his questionable taste in fashion was to watch a man at the giggly intersection of synchronicity and who knew? Advertisement He has had a respectable coaching career. He coached the Cavaliers during James‚Äôs first run, won a passel of games and was named the coach of the year. He also spent a disastrous season as coach of the Lakers, but who hasn‚Äôt of late? The rap on Brown was that he is strong on defense ‚Äî his teams invariably give up among the fewest points in the league ‚Äî and a wandering soul on offense whose substitution patterns drive analysts and fans to distraction. The Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert recruited Brown to Cleveland for a second time in 2013. At the time, Gilbert apologized for his stupidity in firing Brown the first time around. A year later, Gilbert again fired Brown. To be a billionaire ‚Äî Gilbert owns Quicken Loans ‚Äî is to require no consistency and no thought of yourself. No matter: The second time around, Brown laid a fat piece of cheese in the mouse trap. He insisted on a five year, $20 million deal ‚Äî meaning that the Cavaliers are, in part, paying him to coach the Warriors. No wonder Brown was quick with a grin on the dais. Does the confusion about who is coaching ever get to him? He shook his head. Kerr insists that Brown make his own choices during the game. He was pressed to talk about what he has learned. Has Warriors life changed him? This time he nodded. ‚ÄúI was a guy who wanted to squeeze every ounce I could out of every minute we were together,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be that way.‚Äù Kerr, he noted, demands only that basketball be fun and collegial. Brown pointed to Green, the wiseacre forward/guard/center and the team‚Äôs basketball savant. ‚ÄúThe stuff he does on the floor ‚Äî during timeouts, in practice, in film sessions, whatever ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost irreplaceable,‚Äù he said. In Game 1, the Cavaliers went on a run and Brown called a timeout. He began to draw up a play, but Green shook his head. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòNo, no, no, we‚Äôre going to do this,‚Äô‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúWhen you have players of his stature that are confident about wanting to do something, you sit back and you let them do it.‚Äù Advertisement And did it work? Brown gave that cat-that-swallowed-the-canary grin. ‚ÄúIt was the absolute right play call.‚Äù Does that work on a less talented, less cohesive team? Perhaps not. But on the mountaintop of the world‚Äôs beautiful game, which is to say many thousands of miles from the Triangle-obsessed Knicks team president, this is what the league looks like. The players drive the car no less than the coaches and the general managers, and the future is so bright they all need to wear shades.

Technology,"Advertisement  Bits  By                       FARHAD MANJOO   JAN. 19, 2018  Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo, technology columnist at The New York Times, reviews the week‚Äôs news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Good morning, readers! It was an interesting week in the tech world. Let‚Äôs get to the news. One thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale ‚Äî the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don‚Äôt make for great optics. There‚Äôs a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites. Well, they want you to know they aren‚Äôt. Amazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday, the company announced the 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There‚Äôs one city in Canada ‚Äî Toronto ‚Äî and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there‚Äôs oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win. Meanwhile, in its own very well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money ‚Äî the largest tax bill ever paid ‚Äî and invest billions in new facilities and people in the United States. The company is also giving many of its employees a $2,500 bonus. Advertisement Apple‚Äôs announcement made Trump very happy. And the president‚Äôs victory lap is, I think, somewhat deserved. Trump and the tech industry have not had the warmest relationship, but it‚Äôs clear that his campaign ‚Äî in which he constantly harangued Apple and Amazon for perceived slights ‚Äî has shaken the industry from its presumption that everyone in the country loves it.

Just a few weeks ago, people brave enough to enter the market for Bitcoin and its many rival electronic currencies looked like lucky geniuses. They were suddenly making millions, even billions ‚Äî and you were kicking yourself for overlooking the crypto boom. Advertisement Well, now you‚Äôre the genius (if still poor). Much of the cryptocurrency market took a bath this week, with Bitcoin falling below $10,000 at one point, more than 50 percent off its December peak. Reddit was flooded with panicked crypto lovers, but, as it usually does, the market leveled off by the end of the week, and crypto-heads were professing to be back on board for the long haul. Godspeed, I guess. There wasn‚Äôt so much else in tech news this week, so take some time to read some great magazine stories. In Bloomberg Businessweek, Eric Newcomer and Brad Stone have a dishy inside look at how Travis Kalanick, Uber‚Äôs co-founder and former hard-charging C.E.O., fell from grace. Among the details: During one harrowing Kalanick-caused scandal, he fell to ‚Äúhis hands and knees and began squirming on the floor.‚Äù Also, Steven Johnson has a fascinating piece in The New York Times Magazine about the uses for the blockchain, the technology undergirding cryptocurrencies. And in The New Yorker, there‚Äôs a lovely ode to blogging and The Awl, a much-beloved Brooklyn web magazine that sadly called it quits this week. Speaking of quits: See you next week!

Sign up here. You can also follow us on Instagram. Dear readers, In the first trial, only one of the more than 50 women with stories so similar to the case at hand was permitted to take the stand. In the first trial, the jury questioned why all these victims hadn‚Äôt spoken up sooner. In the first trial, the jury deliberated for six days ‚Äî and remained deadlocked. And Bill Cosby, the once-beloved comedian charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, remained free. Free to perform, in January, at a Philadelphia jazz club, where he joked about his struggles with blindness and played drums with a quartet. Now Mr. Cosby, 80, faces up to 30 years in prison. As the guilty verdict came in Thursday afternoon, with the jury convicting the actor of three felony counts, I had to remind myself: that first trial was just 11 months ago. In terms of collective consciousness, it might as well have been a lifetime. It was before #MeToo. It was before Harvey Weinstein, before Larry Nassar, before Matt Lauer, and Kevin Spacey, and Charlie Rose, and so many others whose names are less known but whose victims make up this army. It was before the spark that lit a worldwide movement; before the world seemed to be fully listening. My colleague Timothy Williams wrote on Thursday that the two trials present what social scientists might call ‚Äúa natural experiment.‚Äù Because in the retrial, the jury heard from five women beyond Ms. Constand who testified about having been abused by Mr. Cosby, not just one (those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted). In this trial, the jury asked questions about the legal definition of consent, and were told by the judge to use common sense. ‚ÄúCommon sense has evolved,‚Äù wrote the law professor Deborah Tuerkheimer in the hours after the verdict came in. In this trial, the verdict came on the second day of deliberations. In this trial, as Gloria Allred, the lawyer for many of the accusers, put it outside the courtroom: ‚ÄúWomen were finally believed.‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking about that and more this week. Read on for what I‚Äôm reading, musing and raging about, as well as a couple of LOLs.

Murmurs of a possible comeback for figures felled in recent months by accusatons of sexual misconduct, including the comedian Louis C.K. and the chef Mario Batali has raised the question: What does this mean for #MeToo?

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by News Analysis By Peter Baker WASHINGTON ‚Äî After more than a dozen Russians and three companies were indicted on Friday for interfering in the 2016 elections, President Trump‚Äôs first reaction was to claim personal vindication: ‚ÄúThe Trump campaign did nothing wrong ‚Äî no collusion!‚Äù he wrote on Twitter. He voiced no concern that a foreign power had been trying for nearly four years to upend American democracy, much less resolve to stop it from continuing to do so this year. The indictment secured by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, underscored the broader conclusion by the American government that Russia is engaged in a virtual war against the United States through 21st-century tools of disinformation and propaganda, a conclusion shared by the president‚Äôs own senior advisers and intelligence chiefs. But it is a war being fought on the American side without a commander in chief. In 13 months in office, Mr. Trump has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront Moscow for its intrusion or to defend democratic institutions against continued disruption. His administration has at times called out Russia or taken action, and even Mr. Trump‚Äôs national security adviser, speaking in Germany on Saturday, called evidence of Russian meddling ‚Äúincontrovertible.‚Äù But the administration has been left to respond without the president‚Äôs leadership. ‚ÄúIt is astonishing to me that a president of the United States would take this so lightly or see it purely through the prism of domestic partisanship,‚Äù said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat under presidents of both parties who is now at the Atlantic Council. He said it invariably raised questions about whether Mr. Trump had something to hide. ‚ÄúI have no evidence that he‚Äôs deliberately pulling his punches because he has to, but I can‚Äôt dismiss it. No president has raised those kinds of questions.‚Äù Rather than condemn Russia for its actions, Mr. Trump in the past has said he accepts the denial offered by President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump has not imposed new sanctions called for in a law passed by Congress last year to retaliate for the attack on America‚Äôs political system, or teamed up with European leaders to counter a common threat. He has not led a concerted effort to harden election systems in the United States with midterm congressional elections on the horizon, or pressed lawmakers to pass legislation addressing the situation. Michael A. McFaul, an ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, called Mr. Trump‚Äôs reaction to the indictments ‚Äúshockingly weak‚Äù and said he should instead have criticized Mr. Putin for violating American sovereignty or even announced plans to punish Moscow. ‚ÄúInstead, he just focused on his own campaign,‚Äù Mr. McFaul said. ‚ÄúAmerica was attacked, and our commander in chief said nothing in response. He looks weak, not only in Moscow but throughout the world.‚Äù The president‚Äôs silence has not necessarily stopped lower levels of his administration from responding to Russian actions, sometimes going further than Mr. Obama, who was also criticized for not doing enough to counter Moscow‚Äôs threat. The Trump administration has decided to send weapons to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian intervention, and recently imposed sanctions on more human rights violators. After Russia ordered the American Embassy in Moscow to shed most of its staff, the administration responded by ordering Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and diplomatic annexes in New York and Washington. Thirteen Russian nationals have been charged with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process through inflammatory social media posts and organized political rallies. Likewise, in just the past few days, the Trump administration formally blamed Russia for an expansive cyberattack last year called NotPetya and threatened unspecified ‚Äúinternational consequences.‚Äù The nation‚Äôs intelligence agency directors, including those appointed by Mr. Trump, unanimously warned in congressional testimony that Russia was already meddling in this year‚Äôs midterm elections. Mr. Trump‚Äôs own aides readily acknowledge the reality that he does not. Besides describing Russian interference as undeniable on Saturday, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said Mr. Mueller‚Äôs charges made clear that Russia had been engaged in a ‚Äúsophisticated form of espionage‚Äù against the United States. ‚ÄúWith the F.B.I. indictment, the evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain,‚Äù he said. Late Saturday night, however, Mr. Trump, contradicted General McMaster, writing on Twitter shortly before midnight that his aide ‚Äúforgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia‚Äù and the Democrats. In a second late-night tweet, Mr. Trump said that the F.B.I. missed warning signs of the gunman who killed 17 people at a Florida school on Wednesday because it was too focused on the Russia investigation. ‚ÄúVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThis is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.‚Äù Mr. Trump has long viewed reports of Russian intrusion as a threat to his legitimacy, a way for Democrats, the news media or the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù to question his victory in the Electoral College over Hillary Clinton in 2016. When his Justice Department indicted the 13 Russians and three Russian entities on Friday for trying to ‚Äúsow discord in the U.S. political system,‚Äù the president focused on the fact that no evidence was presented that he or his campaign was knowingly involved. Indeed, the indictment made no assertion that the president or anyone affiliated with him did anything wrong, understandably a relief for Mr. Trump, given a year of investigation and media reports exploring the possibility of collaboration with Russia. The ‚Äúinformation warfare against the United States,‚Äù as one Russian organization called it, started as early as 2014, predating Mr. Trump‚Äôs entry into the race. But the indictment also determined that by 2016 the effort had evolved into a deliberate attempt to support Mr. Trump and disparage Mrs. Clinton. And the charges against the Russians are not the end of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, nor do they mean that there were no contacts or cooperation that may eventually spell legal trouble for people in the president‚Äôs orbit. Previous legal filings and news accounts have documented multiple contacts between Mr. Trump‚Äôs team and Russians in 2016. Among them was a June 2016 meeting hosted by Donald Trump Jr., the president‚Äôs son, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, his campaign chairman, on the promise that Russian visitors would provide incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton as part of the Russian government‚Äôs support of the elder Mr. Trump. The findings included in Friday‚Äôs indictment bolstered the conclusions of American intelligence agencies, which for more than a year have said that Russia interfered in the election, a determination that Mr. Trump has occasionally accepted but more often dismissed as a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù Only in a written statement that aides issued in his name after his tweet on Friday was any concern expressed about the Russian attack described in the indictment, and then only to urge his critics to stop questioning him. ‚ÄúWe cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord and rancor to be successful,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs position stood in contrast to that of fellow Republicans who responded to the indictment with calls for tougher action against Russia. To many, the president‚Äôs reaction once again raised the question of why he would go easy on Moscow. He has spoken about Mr. Putin in generally flattering or friendly terms and avoided direct criticism even during moments of enormous stress in the relationship between the two countries. For the moment, the government is left to act without the president. Jeh C. Johnson, a secretary of homeland security under Mr. Obama, said the best way to stop Russia from interfering in the future is the threat of a powerful response. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to cyberattacks, it will always be easier to be on offense than defense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to cyberattacks between nation-states, the most effective defense is to simply make the offensive behavior cost-prohibitive.‚Äù But the best way to do that, experts said, is for the president to lead the way. ‚ÄúThe U.S. government cannot mobilize an effective strategy without White House leadership and prioritization,‚Äù said Heather A. Conley, a State Department official under President George W. Bush who testified at a Senate hearing in the past week on defending against Russian interference. Despite the warnings by the intelligence chiefs and the threat detailed in the indictment, she said, ‚Äúthere continues to be no policy message or response, leaving our country unprotected and vulnerable.‚Äù John P. Carlin, a former assistant attorney general for national security and chief of staff to Mr. Mueller when he was F.B.I. director, said the president‚Äôs silence sent a message to Russia and the world. ‚ÄúI think it does have consequences,‚Äù he said. The American government can warn against further interference, but ‚Äúit would be better if it gets driven by the commander in chief. The goal is to drive a clear message that says the United States and our allies throughout the world that share our values are drawing a line that says ‚Äòstop, this is unacceptable.‚Äô‚Äù Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board To all outward appearances, Russia‚Äôs retaliatory expulsions of American and other diplomats followed the old Cold War pattern: A Soviet deed would prompt Western punitive measures. Moscow would blithely deny any wrongdoing, declare itself victimized by a two-faced West and strike back with equivalent measures. So it was, for example, when the United States boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 over the invasion of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union led an Eastern Bloc boycott of the Los Angeles Games four years later. And so it is now again, in Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia. Mr. Putin has fully embraced the old Kremlin aversion to ever admitting wrongdoing, whether it‚Äôs shooting down a Malaysian jetliner, or killing Alexander Litvinenko, or seizing Crimea, or fighting in eastern Ukraine, or cyber-meddling in Western elections, or doping Olympic athletes. Or using a lethal chemical weapon to poison a double-agent and his daughter in a provincial city in England. So far, d√©j√† vu all over again. But there is a difference, and a potentially dangerous one. During the original Cold War, Moscow and Washington recognized that their ideological hostility and nuclear arsenals needed to be contained, so they talked through back channels and across a ‚Äúhotline‚Äù to prevent unexpected crises from triggering confrontations, worked on disarmament and held regular meetings at all levels, up to the top. A military hotline still operates to avoid clashes between American and Russian forces in Syria, but as tensions rose last week, Ant√≥nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, suggested it was time to revive the Cold War channels of communication and control. ‚ÄúThose mechanisms have been dismantled,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI do believe that mechanisms of this sort are necessary again.‚Äù Post-Communist Russia is not the obvious enemy the Soviet Union was. Throughout Russia‚Äôs slow slide into authoritarianism, there has lingered a hope that relations with Moscow can be reset, as Hillary Clinton sought to do and as President Trump seems eager to do. And while Mr. Putin‚Äôs drive to restore Russian influence and might ‚Äî witness his proud unveiling of an intercontinental missile in March that ‚Äúcan reach any point in the world‚Äù ‚Äî is an echo of Soviet behavior, Russia has also undergone a considerable transformation since 1991. Russians travel widely and have nearly unlimited access to information and technology, and the Soviet command economy has given way to far greater consumerism. More significantly, there is no Western consensus on Russia of the sort that held against the Soviet Union. European politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary or Czech President Milos Zeman are open admirers of Mr. Putin, and President Trump‚Äôs relations with the Kremlin are a major question mark. Though the United States expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle, Mr. Trump made no comment on the crisis, either when he called Mr. Putin last week to congratulate him on his re-election or since. All that makes the current confrontation less predictable than the showdowns of the Soviet past. Both Britain and the United States have left open further actions against Russia, to which Moscow would inevitably respond, and the deterioration in relations could affect efforts to find common ground on Syria or Islamist terrorism. That, however, is not an argument for looking the other way when Russia violates the most elemental norms of international behavior. Russia is not the old Soviet Union, which makes it all the more imperative for the West to send a clear message that the old wiles and subterfuges also belong in the dustbin of history. The former K.G.B. agent in Mr. Putin may find it intolerable that a turncoat is living comfortably in Britain, but it must be made clear to him that the West will unite in fury ‚Äî yes, including Mr. Trump‚Äôs America ‚Äî when Russia‚Äôs most fearsome weapons are deployed in a peaceful English town.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt like to follow the rules. He lies constantly. He cheats on his wife (and not just the current one). His businesses are notorious for stiffing customers and vendors. As president, he has violated one longstanding norm after another. When Trump believes it‚Äôs convenient for him to break a rule, he often just decides that the rule doesn‚Äôt matter. This longstanding pattern probably goes a long way toward explaining yesterday‚Äôs events: The F.B.I. conducted a raid of the office and hotel room of Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen ‚Äî a raid approved by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, who was appointed by the Trump administration just three months ago. Think about how extraordinary this is. Receiving a warrant to search any lawyer‚Äôs office is unusual, given the power of attorney-client privilege. And in this case, the office being searched is that of the lawyer representing the president of the United States. Which means that the search required the approval of both top Justice Department officials and a federal judge. Why would they have granted it? Because they had good reason to believe that Cohen would have refused to follow the rules and voluntarily turn over material relevant to an investigation. As a former senior law enforcement official told CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper, it‚Äôs likely that either Cohen ‚Äúwas so uncooperative they couldn‚Äôt get the information from subpoena or they had proof there was destruction of evidence.‚Äù People who are willing to break the rules can sometimes get away with it for a long time. But sometimes their history and their misbehavior catch up with them. That now may be happening to Trump. If so, thank goodness. We‚Äôre supposed to be a nation of laws, where rulebreaking brings consequences. Related: In The Times, Harry Litman ‚Äî a former federal prosecutor ‚Äî explains what the investigators may be looking for. Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. special agent, says the raid is another sign that the Russia probe may continue even if Trump fires Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation: The president ‚Äúwill be sorely mistaken if he thinks that getting rid of Mueller will stop anything that has already started rolling in our justice system,‚Äù she said. Trump continues to refuse to play by the rules. The government seems to have followed the exact process for conducting a search of an attorney‚Äôs office, as law professor Steve Vladeck notes. Yet Trump ‚Äúmade it sound ‚Äî dangerously ‚Äî like treason,‚Äù writes The New Yorker‚Äôs Amy Davidson Sorkin. ‚ÄúNow more than ever,‚Äù Bill Kristol tweeted, ‚ÄúRepublicans in Congress, and others in leadership roles, should step up‚Äù to protect Mueller. Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, the company‚Äôs C.E.O., will testify before Congress today about Facebook‚Äôs impact on the 2016 election. But what he says matters less than what Congress does, writes Zeynep Tufekci in The Times: ‚ÄúWe already know most everything we need for legislators to pass laws that would protect us from what Facebook has unleashed.‚Äù Elsewhere, Slate‚Äôs April Glaser, Vox‚Äôs Emily Stewart and Wired‚Äôs Nicholas Thompson preview Zuckerberg‚Äôs testimony.

These four Republican senators ‚Äî Susan Collins of Maine, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida ‚Äî are emerging as a bloc integral to the Senate Intelligence Committee‚Äôs investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The investigation is widely considered the premier inquiry, the one with the necessary jurisdiction and the best chance of producing a credible outcome. These four senators loom large as a crucial element in getting there. Despite early skepticism about the Republican-led panel‚Äôs commitment to the investigation, the four have made it clear that they are determined to see it through to a conclusion that would satisfy the public and their colleagues in both parties. To get there, they will have to slog through thousands of pages of raw intelligence held by the C.I.A. and devote untold hours to grinding committee work behind closed doors. ‚ÄúThis is not about the president, this is about the presidency,‚Äù said Mr. Lankford, who was a longtime Baptist youth minister before he entered politics. ‚ÄúThis is about where we are as a nation.‚Äù This is not to say that other members of the panel aren‚Äôt engaged. The committee‚Äôs seven Democrats are certainly interested in finding out whether Russians colluded with the Trump campaign and helped to elect him. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the panel, has shown an increasing zeal for pursuing the question after an uncertain start. He and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee‚Äôs ranking Democrat, have forged a solid working relationship. Three other Republicans are also playing a role: John Cornyn of Texas, who as the No. 2 Senate Republican brings a leadership perspective to the investigation; Jim Risch of Idaho; and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. But it is notable that the other four have quietly coalesced into something of an informal working group within the Intelligence Committee, pushing the investigation forward and consulting not only with each other and Mr. Burr, but also with Mr. Warner. ‚ÄúWe are working very hard and we talk a lot with one another, as well,‚Äù said Ms. Collins, who said the investigation would ‚Äútake as long as required.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a complex investigation, and as you pull the threads, you find that it is connected to a whole lot of other threads in this tapestry that we are not yet seeing the whole of.‚Äù Here is a look at the four and what is driving them: Although she is known as the Republican centrist voice in the Senate, another role she has held in Washington may be equally important in this case: senior Senate staff member. Ms. Collins was a top Senate aide and served in other executive posts before running for office. She is experienced in both conducting and overseeing inquiries. ‚ÄúI really want to know the truth no matter who is implicated, no matter where the evidence leads,‚Äù she said. As a 21-year-old in 1974, she was an intern for Representative William S. Cohen, a freshman Republican congressman from Maine who helped draw up the articles of impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. His colleagues say it would be a mistake to underestimate this junior member of the Senate. Mr. Lankford showed surprising political strength in a 2014 primary fight in a special Senate election in Oklahoma after compiling a conservative record and rapidly raising his profile during two terms in the House. He objected sharply to recent reports that the Senate inquiry was understaffed and moving at a plodding pace. ‚ÄúIf you make a big staff, they get less access to the real documents for intelligence that you need,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou need to keep it with high-level folks in as small a pool as possible and give them the time they need,‚Äù he said. Very few members of Congress make it into the leadership ranks; hardly anyone makes into leadership in the House and in the Senate. Mr. Blunt, the former House majority leader and a savvy inside player, is now the fifth-ranking Republican in the Senate. He has been adamant that Congress pursue the investigation into Russian meddling ‚Äî both to find out what happened and to allow Congress and the White House to move beyond it. ‚ÄúEveryone would benefit if we do this job in the right way and do it not faster than we can, but as fast as we can,‚Äù he said. Mr. Blunt has been a consistent voice that the committee must be thorough. ‚ÄúWhen we are done, we need to have talked to everybody a reasonable person would think we should talk to and have seen everything a reasonable person would think we should see,‚Äù he said. After his failed presidential bid, he almost didn‚Äôt return to the Senate, but a change of heart has thrust him into the middle of an inquiry surrounding the election of his Republican primary race rival. In a recent appearance on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù Mr. Rubio suggested that committee work would not just lay out for the public what the Russians did, ‚Äúbut how they did it and what it means for the future and what we should be doing about it.‚Äù A proponent of a hard line with Russia, Mr. Rubio dismissed Mr. Trump‚Äôs complaint that he was the victim of a witch hunt. ‚ÄúWe are nation of laws and we are going to follow those laws,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe president is entitled to his opinion.‚Äù There is no doubt that political conflict will erupt as the inquiry advances. These four senators will be crucial in determining whether it stays on track. Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Technology,"Advertisement By CHARLIE SAVAGEAPRIL 12, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî As President Trump continued to seethe over F.B.I. raids this week on the office and hotel room of his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, a chorus of his supporters have been publicly urging him to fire Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who signed off on the move. The clear idea behind the suggestion ‚Äî which Mr. Trump is also said to be weighing ‚Äî is that ousting Mr. Rosenstein would enable the White House to put the criminal investigations encircling the president‚Äôs associates on a tighter leash, or even to shut them down. Here is a look at some of the issues at stake. A longtime Justice Department official, Mr. Rosenstein was not part of Mr. Trump‚Äôs inner circle before Attorney General Jeff Sessions persuaded the president to designate him as deputy. After Mr. Sessions recused himself from investigations related to the 2016 election, Mr. Rosenstein became acting attorney general for those matters. He appointed Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, to scrutinize ties between the Trump campaign and Russia‚Äôs interference in the election. He signed off as Mr. Mueller‚Äôs focus expanded to whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice and whether Mr. Trump‚Äôs onetime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, committed crimes related to his work for Ukraine‚Äôs pro-Russian government. Mr. Rosenstein also approved the decision to get search warrants for Mr. Cohen‚Äôs files. Advertisement Mr. Trump has bitterly denounced Mr. Sessions‚Äôs recusal, saying he needs an attorney general who will protect him. Advertisement Mr. Cohen‚Äôs lawyer has said the investigation that led to the search warrants stemmed from a referral made by Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office. But it was carried out by prosecutors in the public integrity section of the office of the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Geoffrey S. Berman, the interim United States attorney, recused himself, so his deputy, Robert S. Khuzami, a former head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, leads that case. It appears to focus on allegations of bank fraud and campaign-finance violations related to efforts to pay off women who said they had had affairs with Mr. Trump. Mr. Rosenstein could have expanded Mr. Mueller‚Äôs jurisdiction to include that matter, but instead he apparently handed it to a different office. As a result, there is now a separate prosecutorial team that has seen evidence about matters close to the president that it ‚Äî and the federal magistrate judge who issued the search warrant ‚Äî found worth investigating. ‚ÄúThis is effectively a blockchain prosecution strategy in which the files appear to be dispersed,‚Äù said Neal Katyal, a former Justice Department official in the Clinton and Obama administrations who drafted the department‚Äôs special counsel regulation. Critics of Mr. Trump who fear that he may try to derail the investigation, such as by pardoning everyone involved, have taken comfort in a Politico report in August that suggested that Mr. Mueller was teaming up with New York‚Äôs attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and sharing evidence about Mr. Manafort. Mr. Schneiderman can pursue financial and other offenses that are crimes under state law, and Mr. Trump cannot pardon state offenses. However, the impression created by that article appears to have been somewhat overstated. Mr. Schneiderman has no clear jurisdiction to file charges in some of the potential crimes at issue in the core Justice Department investigations, like federal election law offenses. Law enforcement officials familiar with the talks cautioned that neither side was routinely sharing investigative materials.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. It might make it easier to constrain the investigations or even to fire Mr. Mueller ‚Äî and now, perhaps, Mr. Khuzami, too. Mr. Rosenstein has said he will refuse any order to fire Mr. Mueller if he did not believe the special counsel committed misconduct, citing a Justice Department regulation that says such a prosecutor may be removed only by the attorney general and only for good cause. A successor who is more of a loyalist to Mr. Trump might be more amenable to interpreting Mr. Mueller‚Äôs jurisdiction narrowly or to firing him, either by declaring that Mr. Mueller has overstepped or by removing the regulation that protects him from arbitrary removal. No. In and of itself, the removal of Mr. Rosenstein ‚Äî or Mr. Mueller and Mr. Khuzami ‚Äî would not stop the law enforcement officials working for them from continuing to pursue those cases. Advertisement Yes ‚Äî the federal ones. Federal statutes give the attorney general authority over federal legal proceedings and the power to direct the actions of special counsels and United States attorneys, including the authority to decide not to pursue a matter for reasons like prosecutorial discretion. Normally, Mr. Rosenstein‚Äôs top assistant ‚Äî Edward O‚ÄôCallaghan ‚Äî would serve as the acting deputy attorney general. But the Justice Department has long applied the law as forbidding a ‚Äúdouble acting‚Äù official, said Martin Lederman, a Georgetown University law professor who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel during the Obama administration. Under that doctrine, acting attorney general powers over the Russia case would instead pass to the next-ranking official who has been confirmed by the Senate. The succession line currently runs next to Noel J. Francisco, the solicitor general; Steven A. Engel, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel; and then John Demers, the head of the National Security Division. Under the Vacancies Reform Act, when a Senate-confirmed official ‚Äúdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office,‚Äù the president can temporarily replace him with another Senate-confirmed executive branch official. In recent months, there has been repeated discussion of a scenario in which Mr. Trump fires Mr. Sessions and then installs a handpicked loyalist from outside the department and who is not recused from the Russia investigation, like Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. But because of the bar on ‚Äúdouble acting‚Äù officials, installing someone like Mr. Pruitt in Mr. Rosenstein‚Äôs position would not thereby also make him the acting attorney general for the Russia case. Still, there might be a twist. Pointing to a recent Office of Legal Counsel memo that suggests in passing that recusals amount to temporary vacancies, Mr. Lederman said it is possible that the administration could claim that the Vacancies Reform Act empowers Mr. Trump to install someone like Mr. Pruitt directly into the role of acting attorney general for all matters from which Mr. Sessions is recused ‚Äî whether or not that person also becomes the acting deputy. That would be a novel and aggressive use of the act. Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York. Follow Charlie Savage on Twitter @charlie_savage.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press PHOENIX ‚Äî The Phoenix Suns have hired Utah Jazz assistant Igor Kokoskov as their new head coach. The 46-year-old Serbian becomes the first NBA head coach born and raised outside North America. He served as a Suns assistant from 2008 to 2013, a stretch that included Phoenix's 2010 run to the Western Conference finals. Kokoskov agreed to terms with the Suns after the team conducted a long series of initial interviews followed by second interviews with what general manager Ryan McDonough termed ""a handful"" of finalists. Kokoskov inherits an exceedingly young team that compiled a 21-61 record, worst in the NBA and second-worst in franchise history. He succeeds interim coach Jay Triano, who took over after Earl Watson was fired three games into the season. In a statement announcing the hiring, McDonough said Kokoskov ""has been a pioneer throughout his basketball career and he brings a wealth of high-level coaching experience to our club."" ""He was one of the first non-American born assistant coaches at both the NCAA and NBA levels and his most recent coaching stint includes leading the Slovenian national team to the 2017 EuroBasket title, which was the first European title in the history of the country,"" McDonough said. ""Igor's teams have always had a player development focus, a creative style of play and a track record of success."" Kokoskov was with the Jazz on Wednesday night in Houston, where they met the Rockets in the second game of their Western Conference semifinal playoff series. He will take over the Suns as soon as his duties with the Jazz are completed. ""I think Phoenix is getting a guy who's a terrific teacher and tactician,"" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said after the Utah win. ""I've known Igor since I was an assistant at Duke and he was a young coach touring the U.S. We have a special relationship that goes back 20 years. I'm excited for him. He's been a terrific assistant for a long time and can't thank him enough. We'll try to keep him here as long as we can."" Kokoskov is in his 18th season as an NBA assistant coach. In addition to the Jazz and Suns, he was an assistant at Orlando (2015), Cleveland (2013-14), Detroit (2003-08) and Los Angeles Clippers (2000-03). He became a U.S. citizen on June 18, 2010, in a ceremony on the court at Phoenix's Talking Stick Resort Arena. He and his family have kept a home in the Phoenix area since his time with the Suns. Kokoskov also was head coach of the Georgia national team from 2008 to 2015, qualifying for the EuroBasket tournament three times. He became the first European to hold a full-time assistant job at an NCAA Division I basketball program after he was hired by then-coach Snyder in 1999. Snyder hired Kokoskov as an assistant there three seasons ago. ___ AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press CLEVELAND ‚Äî Mike Brown happily slid into his normal seat to the left of Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr for Game 2 of the N.B.A. finals. For the first time in weeks, the team was whole again. Brown has moved before ‚Äî not always so willingly ‚Äî and during the next few days, he will return to a familiar place. Brown, a well-liked top assistant at Golden State, arrived there after two stints as a head coach during which he nurtured a young LeBron James and then a pampered Kobe Bryant. Now the Warriors are traveling to Cleveland, the city that shaped Brown more than any other. It is where he was hired twice and fired twice by the Cavaliers, who are paying him until 2020, and where he raised his two sons. It is where he rooted himself in the community and stayed after losing his job in 2014, and where he still has a home and keeps one of his Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which he took for cruises along Lake Erie to clear his mind. ‚ÄúHe loves those Harleys,‚Äù Warriors forward Draymond Green said. ‚ÄúThat just means he has them in every city he goes to. That‚Äôs an addiction.‚Äù When Game 3 tips off Wednesday night, with the Warriors holding a two-games-to-none lead, Brown will be back in the building where he and James appeared in their first finals 10 years ago. In 2007 the Cavaliers were no match for the powerful San Antonio Spurs, who overwhelmed Cleveland and swept the series. ‚ÄúCircle of life,‚Äù Brown said last week. ‚ÄúLike the ‚ÄòLion King,‚Äô everything comes back around, I guess.‚Äù For Brown, 47, his finals debut must seem like a lifetime ago. This postseason he guided the Warriors to an 11-0 record while Kerr battled intense pain stemming from back operations. ‚ÄúMy guy did O.K. while I was gone,‚Äù Kerr said after the Warriors won Sunday night. During last year‚Äôs finals in Cleveland, Brown met with Kerr about joining the Warriors‚Äô staff to replace Luke Walton, who was named the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. The interview came before the Cavaliers rallied from a three-games-to-one deficit, and before Kevin Durant announced he was headed to Golden State. After Brown was fired for the second time by the Cavaliers, he had stepped outside the coaching circle, choosing to watch his oldest son, Elijah, play basketball at New Mexico and filming the high school football games of his other son, Cameron. All the while, he stayed connected by talking with San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich, his mentor and former boss. Popovich urged him to join Kerr. Brown‚Äôs willingness to accept an assistant‚Äôs job despite 563 regular-season wins ‚Äî and 47 in the playoffs ‚Äî underscores his humility. Last week, the Cavaliers All-Star guard Kyrie Irving said he wished his time with Brown had been longer. ‚ÄúI was a 21-year-old kid, just trying to lead a franchise, and he was a new head coach that I had to get introduced to a new offense, new players, as well as a new system,‚Äù Irving said. ‚ÄúI kind of regret being part of that because he was just trying to teach me a lot of things that I didn‚Äôt necessarily understand as a 21-year-old. So he definitely had some great things, and the knowledge of the game that‚Äôs up there with some great coaches.‚Äù Brown could be in demand again. Kerr‚Äôs health may prompt a reshuffling at Golden State, and there are certain to be other coaching vacancies. Yet Brown is not in any hurry to pack up, and he is not viewing his trip to Cleveland as anything more than business. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking at this as Cleveland fired me twice, this is the time to get back at them, or is there any extra incentive?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just want to win. I just want to be a part of a winning program and be the last team, quote-unquote, standing.‚Äù     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press NEW ORLEANS ‚Äî Rajon Rondo and Draymond Green have won NBA titles and never have been known to shy away from conflict on the court. Now their combustible convergence in the playoffs is providing a spicy subplot to the Western Conference semifinal series between New Orleans and Golden State. ""We're here to fight,"" Rondo said following New Orleans' lopsided Game 3 victory that trimmed the Warriors' series lead to 2-1. ""With my guys on the court, I'm going to fight as hard as I can ... and do whatever it takes."" Green and Rondo had to be separated after whistles twice in the first three games ‚Äî never mind some other antics in the flow of the game ‚Äî and they'll be back at it again in one of two pivotal Game 4s to be played on Sunday. The other pits Houston against Utah in a series that the Rockets lead 2-1. The Rondo-Green sideshow is compelling because of what both players mean to their teams. They are not the type of trash-talking, loud-mouths who otherwise play marginal roles. They are accomplished leaders who produce. Rondo had 21 assists in Game 3, while Green nearly had a triple-double with 11 points, 12 rebounds and nine assist. It just so happens they also are renowned for their masterful command of psychological gamesmanship. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry might have the best perspective; he's coached them both. Gentry was a Warriors assistant on Golden State's 2015 championship team and maintains a friendly off-court relationship with Green. ""If he's on your team you love him and if he's not on your team you despise him ‚Äî and to me, those are the kind of players that I like to have,"" Gentry said of Green. ""I appreciate who he is and how he plays because he's all about winning. And if you're verbally weak, he's going to take advantage of that."" Warriors coach Steve Kerr calls Green his team's ""heart and soul,"" and its ""engine."" Kerr also added lightheartedly that the fact Green hasn't been assessed a technical foul in the postseason is ""one of the great stats in this year's playoffs."" Green bristled at the notion that he started any of the dust-ups with Rondo, insinuating that Rondo was the instigator. He asserted that his awareness of Rondo's intentions is why he hasn't been suckered into escalations that could result in a technical foul or ejection. ""I'm not an idiot,"" Green said. ""I can see what they're trying to accomplish a mile away."" Green added: ""At some point, somebody's got to tell the truth. It ain't Draymond this time."" But Green has been in the face of other Pelicans, tangling with All-Star Anthony Davis behind the play in one instance and yelling at the Pelicans' bench in another. Green's antics even agitated TNT studio host and former player Charles Barkley, who said he wanted to punch Green in the face. Barkley later apologized for his word choice, if not his sentiment. Pelicans forward Solomon Hill explained that Rondo ‚Äî accomplished, playoff-savvy veteran that he is ‚Äî seeks to neutralize Green's psychological effect by taking on a ""big brother"" role for the Pelicans. ""If somebody's yelling in your ear, you're going to get to a point where it's about respect,"" said Hill, who refers to Rondo by his nickname, Do. ""And that's kind of where Do is. Do's like: 'We're going to be respected. You're not going to come out here and dance around and disrespect us as competitors.'"" A closer look at Sunday's games: WARRIORS AT PELICANS Warriors lead 2-1. Game 4, 3:30 p.m. EDT, ABC. NEED TO KNOW: Although the Warriors lead the series, the Pelicans have not lost at home yet in the playoffs and have improved considerably in each game of this series since losing by 22 in the opener. New Orleans lost by only five points in Game 2 and then won by 19 when the series moved to New Orleans. KEEP AN EYE ON: Warriors stars Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant. They combined to miss 36 of 59 shots in Game 3 and will be eager to regain their shooting strokes. ""I still don't think K.D. or Steph was aggressive enough,"" Green said. ""I've said to both of them, I need them to be aggressive. They're our guys. That's who we're going to to get buckets. We need them to be aggressive at all times and they'll be that way"" on Sunday. INJURY UPDATE: Curry will be in his third game back after missing more than a month with a sprained left knee. Kerr said he wasn't surprised to see Curry's production dip in his second game back. ""Game 2 is always the hardest one after you come back from an injury,"" Kerr said, adding that ""it just takes some time"" for NBA players to regain their energy, legs and rhythm. PRESSURE IS ON: The Pelicans, who don't want to go back to the West Coast down 3-1 and on the brink of elimination. ""We've just got to avoid any kind of letdown,"" Gentry said, adding that his players ""understand who we're playing and they understand the situation."" ROCKETS AT JAZZ Rockets lead 2-1. Game 4, 8 p.m. EDT, ESPN. NEED TO KNOW: Following a surprising home loss in Game 2, the Rockets roared back to life in Game 3, picking apart the Jazz on both ends of the court. A 39-point first quarter put Houston back on track. The Rockets shot 59 percent from the field before halftime and never looked back. ""From the beginning of the game, we made a conscious effort to get stops and offensively push the pace and get shots, and we did that,"" Rockets guard James Harden said. KEEP AN EYE ON: Rockets sixth man Eric Gordon has been a tough cover for the Jazz. Gordon broke out for 25 points on 8-of-13 shooting in Game 3, resembling what he did against Utah in three regular season games in which he averaged 21 points on 48.4 percent shooting. ROOKIE STRUGGLES: Utah's Donovan Mitchell is averaging 16 points on 32 percent shooting in the series while filling in at point guard for Ricky Rubio. He went just 4-of-16 for 10 points in Game 3.

Sports,"Advertisement By THE NEW YORK TIMESMAY 31, 2017  For the third time in three years, the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers will go at it in the N.B.A. finals, which begin Thursday night. We asked more than a dozen writers and editors at The New York Times for their take on the series. While most of them picked the Warriors, there were dissenters, too. Their thoughts: As we tiptoe toward an N.B.A. finals matchup that we can only hope revives an otherwise comatose trip through the playoffs ‚Äî and trust me, I‚Äôve already sat through my share of snoozers in Toronto, San Antonio and Oakland ‚Äî let‚Äôs revisit some recent history. About this time last year, the Warriors had built a three-games-to-one lead against the Cavaliers in the finals and appeared to be closing in on their second straight championship. Reacquainting themselves with the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Championship Trophy seemed like a foregone conclusion for the Warriors. It was time to chill the Champagne, right? Wrong. We all know what happened next. Cleveland won the next three games in a stunner. The autopsy revealed a number of contributing causes. There was the subpar play of Stephen Curry, who had sustained ankle and knee injuries in the first round. There was the one-game suspension served by Draymond Green, who had struck too many opponents in the groin. And there was the Warriors‚Äô general fatigue, brought on by their pursuit of a record-setting 73 victories in the regular season. Just think: All of those problems, and yet they were still on the cusp of winning a championship. The Warriors are blissfully free of such problems this time around. No injuries. No fatigue. No shots to the groin, at least to date. And they now employ Kevin Durant, one of the best players in the world. Advertisement We should pause for a moment to throw the obligatory playoff laurels at LeBron James, who is brilliant at basketball. His performance in the finals last year was nothing short of extraordinary. But he still needed to summon all his sorcery to overcome a broken-down, K.D.-free version of the Warriors. Advertisement The Warriors are a better team now than they were a year ago, and not even James is capable of stopping them. Warriors in five. SCOTT CACCIOLA This year‚Äôs N.B.A. finals could be the rubber match for the basketball ages. Both the Cavaliers and the Warriors are marvels to behold, often combining the truisms of the game ‚Äî move without the ball, find the open man, pick and roll, pick and roll ‚Äî with refreshing audacity and panache. Both teams also have players so dominant that at times it seems almost unfair. Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving toy with their defenders like cats with balls of yarn, while Kevin Durant and, especially, LeBron James often seem to be playing against a quivering squad of eighth graders from the Our Lady of Perpetual Help parochial school. Yes, it will be an epic series, with future Hall of Famers battling it out in ways that will have hacks scrambling for metaphors from classical myth. But my instincts tell me that it will be some lesser god who will provide the key defensive play or the and-one basket that makes the difference. In other words, it will not come down to Zeus or Poseidon, but rather some player at the far end of the Olympian table. A Kyle Korver or a Richard Jefferson, a David West or, yes, a JaVale McGee. Last summer, the Dallas Mavericks waived McGee, and it looked as though the much-maligned center‚Äôs N.B.A. career was near its end. But the Warriors came to his rescue, signing him, embracing him and making him feel integral to the team‚Äôs success. McGee might have been distracted recently by a former landlord‚Äôs lawsuit claiming that he had caused damage to his Dallas apartment, been late on payments and flouted a no-pet rule by harboring a nearly hairless cat named Raja. But the athlete has just settled the matter, meaning that his focus, his heart ‚Äî and his gratitude ‚Äî are all in. The Warriors, McGee and Raja, in six. DAN BARRY The greatest sports trilogy of my lifetime was Ali-Frazier, and we know about the physical toll that the decisive fight ‚Äî the Thrilla in Manila ‚Äî took on both noble combatants. Expect the loser of Warriors-Cavs III to suffer a more psychological blow, especially its two most heralded stars ‚Äî LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Advertisement Losing the series would drop James‚Äôs record to 3-5 in N.B.A. finals, allowing the cranky critics to load up on more ammunition to fire at him. A defeat for Durant ‚Äî who has already fallen in one championship showdown with James (and the Miami Heat) ‚Äî would be devastating in that his free-agent leap from Oklahoma City to Golden State was pegged as a virtual championship guarantee. Casting teams as individuals may be a stretch, but let‚Äôs go ahead and equate the Warriors to Ali, dazzling observers and opponents with speed, style, charisma and Draymond Green‚Äôs mouth. The Cavaliers must be Frazier, the pride of Philadelphia, because they are also from a gritty milieu, northeast Ohio. And while an underdog, they always have a puncher‚Äôs chance, thanks to LeBron. James is the figurative Frazier left hook, primed to rearrange the facial features of any anticipated series dynamic. But with Durant replacing Harrison Barnes, who averaged just 9.3 points on 35 percent shooting in last year‚Äôs epic seven-game final between these same two teams, James will have to carry an exhausting load at both ends. That is unless Coach Tyronn Lue can find other mildly effective defenders (Tristan Thompson, Richard Jefferson) to allow James a less taxing chore for at least some of his 40 or so minutes per game. The problem is, there is nowhere to cheat against the Warriors when they go small. Can the Cavs make them pay enough of a price for doing so by pounding them to the body, √† la Frazier, on the offensive glass? The hunch is no. The pick is Golden State, floating, stinging and winning in six. HARVEY ARATON When in the ditch deep, there‚Äôs no point in trying to crawl out. Just keep on digging. ‚Ä¶ A month ago, for this newspaper, I picked the Cavaliers to take another title, and I‚Äôm doubling down in the face of much available data to the contrary. N.B.A. hoop is our beautiful game, and the Warriors play it beautifully. They have All-Stars at nearly every position, and they pass and pass and shoot the prettiest of jump shots. Durant to Thompson to Curry beats Tinker to Evers to Chance. They even play sterling defense. And they are well coached, or the players are so intelligent that the team has become the N.B.A. version of the driverless car. Yet the Cavaliers will win. (The key to prognostication is to sound certain when you know very little.) The Cavs have several All-Stars, although I would have to chew a tab of something before I could argue without giggling that Kyrie Irving is more well rounded than Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, or that Kevin Love outstrips Draymond Green. And then there‚Äôs Durant, that 7-foot freak of nature with the soft touch from anywhere in the Oakland ZIP code. Advertisement No, the difference is that Cleveland has the God of Basketball, and his multiple layers of skill and will edge into the other world. Last year, LeBron James raised his team from the N.B.A. finals crypt. The Warriors were up, three games to one, and planning celebratory excursions to Napa and noodling with the latest toys coughed up by Silicon Valley sycophants. James simply put his wounded team on his shoulders and won, and won, and won. Nate Silver‚Äôs FiveThirtyEight site forecasts the Cavaliers have a 10 percent chance of winning this time around. Of course, he also forecast that we‚Äôd be talking about President Hillary Clinton right now. Just like last year: Cavs in seven. MICHAEL POWELL This trilogy has had too many plot twists, like an overstuffed blockbuster franchise straining to outdo itself. It began with the most outlandish premise of all: The biggest star in the world shuts down his speedboat-and-sunglasses buddy films to ‚Äúcome home‚Äù to a group of Cleveland misfits straight out of an oddball indie ensemble. While LeBron prepared his new cast for prime time, a new kind of star emerged, a California water bug with a mouth guard who has changed every rule we thought we knew about scoring. They eye each other from across the country. Previous generations had Magic vs. Bird, the Lakers vs. the Celtics, Showtime‚Äôs short shorts vs. Bird‚Äôs French Lick mustache. This is our rivalry. LeBron vs. Steph, power vs. quickness, the Rust Belt vs. Silicon Valley. The first two installments of the trilogy were so good that the story line consumed the N.B.A., turning the regular season into an endless movie trailer. The trilogy‚Äôs high points have been chiseled into stone. The 73 wins. The 3-1 collapse. The Block. Advertisement The trilogy has included big-screen swagger. ‚ÄúI feel confident,‚Äù LeBron declared during the 2015 finals, ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm the best player in the world.‚Äù You can picture Jason Bourne saying something similar as he steps over a pile of vanquished bad guys. And now we reach the next installment, but with a bit of trepidation. The third one is always the hardest ‚Äî the ‚ÄúReturn of the Jedi,‚Äù with the too cute Ewoks, was the weakest of the original ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù films. The third Godfather film couldn‚Äôt live up to the others. The third Cavs-Warriors finals has the makings of a letdown as well. The addition of Kevin Durant feels like one of those twists concocted by nervous producers desperate for a big opening weekend. The balance is off. The Warriors overflow with brand-name stars. They are likely to reclaim the trophy, but at what cost? The Cavs-Warriors trilogy, the greatest story in basketball, may end with a fizzle. Warriors in five. SAM DOLNICK The Warriors will win, of course, but I say that every year ‚Äî and I mean every year. I am a casual N.B.A. fan who has rooted blindly for Golden State for more than a quarter-century. I reflexively point this out all the time now so nobody will call me a bandwagon Warriors fan. I earned this seat on the ride. My hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, made some stupid trades when I was 11. I went searching for a new team and eventually fell in love with the Run TMC Warriors of the early 1990s: T for Tim Hardaway, M for Mitch Richmond, C for Chris Mullin. It was the perfect team for a baseball-crazy teenager who would not recognize the subtleties of basketball. Those Warriors ran and ran and ran, scored and scored and scored. They had cool uniforms, they used to play in Philly, their name was fun to say. I was in. The novelty of cheering for an out-of-town team never wore off. The Warriors were my choice, and I would not admit I had chosen poorly. They lost many games for many years. They seemed to be run ineptly. But their fans ‚Äî out in that magical land called Golden State ‚Äî also seemed unusually devoted.

So I kept hoping, checking the Warriors‚Äô box scores, reading up on the team, buying merchandise, catching their games on the road here and there. I stayed optimistic, maybe because I didn‚Äôt study the league enough to know better. Advertisement Now, of course, the Warriors ‚Äî the Dubs! ‚Äî are pretty much the perfect team, justifiably popular with fans everywhere. It‚Äôs strange to see, having cared so long for a team without a national following. The Warriors are so likable that they even gave Cleveland a gift last June, a long-awaited championship for a city steeped in losing. What a great bunch of guys. We‚Äôll take it back now, though. In four games. Did I mention I always think the Warriors will win? TYLER KEPNER The Warriors won 67 games in the regular season, 16 more than the Cavaliers despite seeming to play at half-speed at times. They are 12-0 in the playoffs. The Warriors took one of the best teams in N.B.A. history last year and added Kevin Durant. They scored 5 more points a game than the Cavs did this season and surrendered 3 fewer. They led the league in shooting percentage, and assists, and steals, and blocked shots. Defense? Teams shot only .435 against them and .324 from 3-point range. Both numbers were the best in the league. This one‚Äôs simple, folks. LeBron James wills the Cavaliers to one win, maybe. Warriors in five.VICTOR MATHER Who‚Äôs going to win this series? I have no idea. I can barely wrap my head around the fact that this is the third time in a row that these two teams are meeting in the finals. This has never happened in the history of the N.B.A. It‚Äôs not exactly common in the other major team sports, either. This, however, is the first instance of a ‚Äúthree match‚Äù in which the two teams split the first two. So this matchup is going to be the rubber match to end all rubber matches. (In case you‚Äôre wondering, the term ‚Äúrubber match‚Äù apparently dates to 16th century English lawn bowling, with the rubber referring to an eraser. Thus, the winner took the series and erased everything prior.) The N.B.A. is also the one league in which two teams meeting in the finals for the third straight year will generate enormous excitement. Can you imagine if the Super Bowl featured the same two teams three years in a row? I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be as intrigued as we are now. Advertisement So who is going to win? Well, I see that ESPN‚Äôs Stephen A. Smith has incorrectly picked the last six N.B.A. finals. That‚Äôs pretty remarkable, in its own way. Who does he pick this year? The Warriors in seven. O.K., I‚Äôll take the Cavs in six. FRED BIERMAN I want to believe. I want to believe that this Cavs team, which has treated defensive rotation as optional for the last five months, will be able to maintain its focus. That LeBron James will treat Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala like the various Pacers, Raptors and Celtics defenders before them. That Kyrie Irving will be at his best. That Kevin Love can stay on the floor. That J. R. Smith will be locked in. That they can make a series out of this. But here‚Äôs the thing: Last year‚Äôs Warriors team, who were the best, the most fun and the easiest to root for team that I‚Äôve seen, should never have blown a 3-1 finals lead to the Cavs. But Stephen Curry was not himself, and the rest of the Warriors were tired after winning 73 games during the regular season. Even then, however, the Cavs needed Green to be suspended and Irving and James to go for 41 each in Game 6 to have a chance. Here‚Äôs another thing: The Warriors added Kevin Durant, and Curry, Klay Thompson and Green are still there. The Cavs added Deron Williams. A fine player now that he‚Äôs back in shape, but come now. And one more thing: Curry is healthy this time around. Sure, the Cavs can try last year‚Äôs tactic and run him through endless screens, try to tire him out. Go for it. This year, he can take some plays off on offense and know that Durant will do his thing. I want to believe. But it feels the Cavs aren‚Äôt playing for the title. They‚Äôre playing to stop the Warriors from sweeping the playoffs. DAN GENDLER For nearly his entire career, LeBron James has had general managers trying to build the perfect team around him. The best player of his generation, James cannot quite do it all by himself, so he has shuffled through teammates rapidly, with things never seeming perfect. Advertisement This year, with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love both clicking, Tristan Thompson doing his best impression of a poor man‚Äôs Moses Malone on the offensive glass, Kyle Korver knocking down 3-pointers and Deron Williams taking some of the burden off James in terms of playmaking, he may finally have his ideal set of complementary players. The problem for James is that while the Cavs were improving, Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors were hardly standing still. Stephen Curry, winner of the last two Most Valuable Player Awards, took last year‚Äôs collapse in the finals to heart and signed off on the team bringing in Kevin Durant, an elite player whose impact predictably ended Curry‚Äôs M.V.P. streak. Thanks to the addition of Durant, Kerr was able to further refine Golden State‚Äôs offense, and 30-assist games became the norm for the Warriors, who accomplished the feat 50 times this season, with Denver way back in second with 19. Curry, Durant and Draymond Green took solid hits in their personal scoring numbers, but the entire team played with such intensity on both ends of the court that once you adjusted for pace they had the best offense in the N.B.A. and the second-best defense. And that was before the playoffs, where they found an even higher gear and steamrollered to the finals with a 12-0 record. This series is likely to carry huge implications for both teams, with legacies being shifted significantly. While James is too good to be swept aside by the Warriors, the Cavaliers simply cannot stand up to the onslaught that the Warriors are poised to deliver. Warriors in five.  BENJAMIN HOFFMAN The Cavaliers actually have two advantages in this series: first, the best player in the league in LeBron James and second, a rebounding advantage in the frontcourt with Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love (and James, for that matter). The Cavaliers weren‚Äôt a particularly good rebounding team as a whole during the regular season. But Love and Thompson are excellent on the boards, and that will be a critical factor in a series in which everything is at stake. Which, in turn, makes the Warriors‚Äô center, Zaza Pachulia, a crucial player. If he is getting punished the way the Celtics‚Äô frontcourt was in the conference finals against Cleveland, it will give the Warriors‚Äô small-ball lineup fits. And while I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm typing this, 7-foot JaVale McGee is suddenly going to be essential for the Warriors off the bench. He needs to play well. But the flip side to this is that the elite and versatile offensive weaponry that the Warriors possess in their small-ball lineup will be very difficult for the Cavaliers ‚Äî a weak defensive team ‚Äî to guard. Advertisement I find it hard to believe that Love will be able to effectively guard the Kevin Durants and Draymond Greens of the world, especially on the perimeter. I presume there will be a lot of switching by the Cavaliers to try to limit the damage ‚Äî but the potential for consistent mismatches is high. And these Warriors move the ball extremely well to exploit those mismatches. The Warriors led the league by a wide margin in percentage of baskets off an assist. When Cleveland defenders leave their man, even for a second, that‚Äôs all the window that the Warriors will need to find the open player. And the entire starting lineup for Golden State, except for Pachulia, is stacked with ballhandlers. James had to put in a superhuman performance for the Cavaliers to win last year. It was improbable. And even then it came down to the final minute of Game 7. He may be superhuman again this time, but I don‚Äôt think he will be good enough. Warriors in six. SOPAN DEB Was it that long ago that the Cavs were down, three games to one, to the Warriors and still went on to win the N.B.A. championship? A year later, both teams still have superstars in their starting lineups, but I think it will come down to the bench. And I believe the Cavs have the edge in that department, with Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, Deron Williams and Kyle Korver. As for defense, I defer to LeBron James‚Äôs remarkable ability to produce come-from-behind blocks that will rattle the Warriors, just as they did a year ago. Both teams are healthy, both have had plenty of rest, but the Cavs will prevail. EARL WILSON I have a prediction, which is that the Warriors will win Game 7 by 20 points. That puts me with the large majority of our other forecasters. Still, more interesting to me is how the Cavaliers seem to have less at stake than the Warriors do in this series. If LeBron doesn‚Äôt win another title, he will face criticism, but there may be nothing James and his team can do that will really change their overall narrative. Advertisement If the Cavs lose, all it says is that Golden State, having added Kevin Durant to last season‚Äôs 73-win squad, is the better team. If the Cavs win, good for them, but it probably means that Golden State choked again after (stop me if you‚Äôve heard this) blowing a 3-1 lead in last year‚Äôs finals. What I see as this year‚Äôs lack of Cleveland drama is partly a function of last year‚Äôs bounty of it, with James tidily completing his championship arc. At 32, he would doubtlessly love a fourth title to hasten his ascent up Mount Jordan (elevation: six rings). But this may be James‚Äôs lowest-stakes playoff series in a decade. By contrast, the Warriors are the protagonist, with something clearly to lose. There is, for instance, a lot riding on Durant‚Äôs quest for his first championship. And there is also the Golden State majority owner, Joe Lacob, and his forever war with his own ego. He does not want to be shown up again by the Cavs. But for me, the most intriguing issue concerns Draymond Green. Will he restrain himself from chastising a Warriors teammate to the news media? Can he refrain from kneeing an opponent where it hurts most? Do the Warriors paradoxically need him to do all those things? As in every tragedy ‚Äî but a few comedies, too ‚Äî character is fate.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press NEW YORK ‚Äî On the night LeBron James began the second round of the playoffs, a computerized Cavalier tormented teams the way the real Cleveland superstar does. The NBA is betting there are enough fans for both versions. The league is staging the opening tournament this week of its NBA 2K League , hoping to cash in on the combination of the global popularity of basketball and the burgeoning business of esports. Television ratings have soared in recent years to watch James, the rise of the Warriors, and a thrilling era of high-flying dunkers and long-range snipers. But will fans really race to their computers to watch other people sitting around playing video games? ""I think the esports universe is answering that question for us,"" NBA 2K League managing director Brendan Donohue said. ""People are completely, 100 percent engaged with watching others play games. I think Twitch is walking proof of that, and all the success these other games have had. The esports space has doubled in size the last three years and every prediction is it's going to double in size the next three years, so I think we're almost beyond that question a little bit."" So do NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and many of his owners. Donohue said the league hoped to get eight to 12 teams for its inaugural season and instead got 17, with enough interest remaining that he expects rapid expansion. Some owners of NBA clubs were already invested in popular esports such as Overwatch and League of Legends and had seen their arenas host well-attended competitions even before the league created the first official esports league operated by a U.S. professional sports league. ""Esports are big and getting bigger. 2K is a way to connect not only with gamers, but gamer fans and to turn both into NBA and Mavs fans and vice versa,"" Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban wrote in an email. ""We think we can take traditional NBA fans, 2K fans and strengthen the bond they have to the NBA."" Each of the major sports leagues is looking to claim its share of what Newzoo, the market research firm, reports will be a $1 billion industry by 2019. The opening day of the Tipoff tournament had some excitement, highlighted by two 40-point performances by Cavs Legion GC's Brandon Caicedo, who plays under the handle Hood. (The players are playing as themselves, not the guys on the NBA's Cavaliers.) But the league was already encouraged by the response even before the games began. When Cuban's team used the No. 1 pick on Artreyo Boyd (Dimez) in the draft, Donohue said 450,000 watched on Twitch, the streaming service popular with video-game players that will feature NBA2K action. More than 40 percent of that audience was from outside the U.S., providing the international eyeballs that have been so crucial to the NBA. Some of the players drafted that day bring their own individual fan bases that have watched streams of their games in other competitions, and even people who don't know the competitors may know enough about basketball to watch anyway. Kings Guard Gaming's Mitchell Franklin, the No. 4 overall pick whose gamer handle is Mootyy, said that's what separates NBA 2K from Overwatch League and Dota 2, which draw huge esports audiences. ""Me, and I know I'm not the only person, I know there's tons, if you don't know what's going on, you turn it on, you don't know what's going on,"" he said. ""With 2K, it's very similar to basketball. It's not like any unique twists or turns to it, so the average basketball fan, anyone and their mother that's ever picked up a basketball can literally flip it on and really see and understand what's happening."" The only thing the league can't provide, at least for the first season, is the live atmosphere of playing in the arena. All games and tournaments will take place in a Long Island City studio, which features a first-of-its-kind competition venue in which the teams sit five on a side, diagonally from the player at their same position, with monitors in front of them and a huge video board called ""the boat"" above. There's a table above the playing stage for the pregame studio analysts and one gameside for the duo calling the game, making it look just like an NBA game. Except that there are only about 115 seats for fans, so teams playing Warriors Gaming Squad won't face anywhere near the noise they would if traveling to Oracle Arena in Oakland, California. Donohue said perhaps next season the league would experiment with taking some games on the road, but doesn't seem concerned about the location for now. ""We think the vast majority of the audience, no different than any sport, is actually outside of the building,"" he said. ""So no different for us."" The NBA is treating the gamers just like players, including the same rookie transition program that first-year players receive, where they get everything from media training to lessons about sleep and nutrition, and explanations of their benefits. And they will receive the same power of the league's marketing arm, which has made one-name stars of its players for years and now will attempt to do the same with its gamers. ""I think now you combine the same talents, you have NBA teams and the NBA, you have 2K and their story telling and the incredible talents they have,"" Donohue said. ""It's the same folks who are actually doing the story telling, so I think it's a great opportunity for us. And some of the stories are incredible."" Such as Wizards District Gaming's Austin Painter, who left a State Department job shortly before the draft, telling friends and colleagues he was off to go play video games for six months. ""Then they were like, 'What, you said you're quitting a government job to go play 2K?'"" And I was like, yeah, it should be pretty fun. I'm just going like 20 minutes on the other side of the city,"" Painter said. ""So that was like the best reaction. 'Uh, can we get a job doing that?'"" Maybe next season, if they've got enough game. For this one, only 102 of the more than 70,000 qualified candidates made it through the draft process to get picked. The reward was a salary of $32,000-$35,000 and housing expenses for six months, plus access to NBA facilities, training staffs and more. Franklin's team, which has the first dedicated esports training facility and content studio to be located inside a pro sports venue, even trained with UFC Hall of Famer Urijah Faber, Kings Guard's director of Mental Performance and Human Optimization. ""I thought it would just kind of be like a little bit like for show, like he's going to be cool, but woo, I'm still a little sore, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Franklin said. ""We're not used to working out all the time, we're used to being on the stick. So being there and him, like, working us and stuff, it was pretty surreal."" As was the first game, featuring a chaotic situation that would be replayed for hours afterward if it happened in the NBA postseason. Matt Rux and Pistons Gaming led Bucks Gaming in the fourth quarter when suddenly his camera monitor malfunctioned. Unable to see the play, he was called for a defensive 3-second violation, and the ensuing free throw cut the lead to two. But Rux remained calm while his equipment was repaired during a timeout, and not long after hit a 3-pointer that helped put away the game. ""That's like the moment that I've been envisioning for the last 10 years with picturing this moment,"" Rux said, ""getting to play with an esport with this great organization and these great teammates. I couldn't have asked to a better finish to Game 1."" Or a better start for the NBA's new game in town. ___ Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement By REUTERSMAY 4, 2018, 1:10 A.M. E.D.T.  TORONTO ‚Äî  Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James delivered a masterclass on Thursday that left the dispirited Toronto Raptors wondering if there was anything they could do to slow down the game's greatest player. So dominant was the three-times NBA champion at times during a stellar second half performance in Game Two of the Eastern Conference semi-finals, it looked almost as if he was experimenting with difficult shots just for the fun of it. ""That drains you mentally and physically,"" Toronto coach Dwane Casey told reporters. ""He was having one of those nights but we have to keep the scoreboard moving as much as possible at the other end."" James scored a game-high 43 points to power the Cavaliers to a 128-110 victory over the Raptors and a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series, which shifts to Cleveland for the next two games. Advertisement It was an all-too familiar script for a Toronto team that has been eliminated from the NBA playoffs the last two years at the hands of James and the Cavaliers, including a four-game sweep in last season's conference semi-finals. Advertisement This Toronto team had higher hopes of overcoming their previous playoff shortcomings, though, after changing their approach this season with a more balanced attack and an effective bench that helped them finish top seed in the Eastern Conference. Toronto now face a tall order in Cleveland, where they are 0-5 in postseason appearances and will be desperate for a win on Saturday as no NBA team has successfully recovered from being down 0-3 in a best-of-seven playoff series. ""We thrive off adversity, every single guy on this team,"" said Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan, who had a team-high 24 points.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

""We've been in tough situations before and, you know, sometimes when you're put in tough situations, that is what brings out the best in you and that's what point we are at now."" The Raptors got off to a decent start and led by as many as nine points at one point during the second quarter but they also struggled defensively and limped into the half leading by just two points over a Cavaliers team that were smelling blood. From there, Cleveland opened the second half with an 18-5 run and never looked back as they stepped on the Raptors' collective throat to take total control of the series. For his part, James said he and his team mate were not about to get complacent even though they are heading home with a comfortable series lead. ""We will not put our guard down, I won't, so that will trickle down to everybody else,"" said James, who also had 14 assists and eight rebounds. ""We're not satisfied. We came to play some good basketball up here and we look forward to more of a challenge.""

But they have few ideas about how to tame the beast they built. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 Your phone buzzes. A message, an Instagram post, a tweet ‚Äî some bit of digital effluvia has come in, and it‚Äôs right there, promising a brief but necessary hit of connection. All you have to do is look. But, just as an experiment, how long can you resist looking? A minute? Two? If you make it that long, how do you start to feel? Can you concentrate? Does your mind wander at what you‚Äôre missing? And if you give in ‚Äî as you surely will, as you probably do many times a day ‚Äî how do you feel about yourself? The internet was born in text. Now, video and audio are ascendant, writing is being left behind, and everything will be different. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 I‚Äôll make this short: The thing you‚Äôre doing now, reading prose on a screen, is going out of fashion. We‚Äôre taking stock of the internet right now, with writers who cover the digital world cataloging some of the most consequential currents shaping it. If you probe those currents and look ahead to the coming year online, one truth becomes clear. The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text, and the exploding reach and power of audio and video. The distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan have closed. Now simple, guttural digital messages, often with multimedia, are big in politics. By Nellie Bowles FEB. 14, 2018 Political memes have gone mainstream as the distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan has closed. President Trump has frequently retweeted his fans‚Äô meme work, #MeToo jumped from social media to every workplace, and political campaigns started to invest in the form more seriously. The political meme ‚Äî text over an image, sometimes short videos or digital clip art meant to spread and be imitated ‚Äî is often a guttural, simple message couched in humor, like the doctored video from September of Hillary Clinton being hit with his golf ball. There are now more ways to tell if your tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because of the ratio. By Mike Isaac FEB. 14, 2018 It‚Äôs easy to tell when you‚Äôve nailed a good tweet ‚Äî just watch the likes and retweets pile up as the post goes viral. Now there are also more ways to tell if a tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because a new barometer for Twitter blahness has taken hold: the ratio. It‚Äôs harder to ignore harassment, or retaliate against accusers, when reports are bolstered by the stories of many others and the public is watching. By Claire Cain Miller FEB. 14, 2018 Susan Fowler had tried going to human resources. She had tried going to her managers. She had tried transferring departments. But nothing changed. The sexual and sexist comments she received as an engineer at Uber kept coming. So she went online and wrote a 3,000-word blog post exposing the behavior. Major companies have been forced to rethink how they advertise online after coming under fire when their digital ads appeared next to racist or fake-news content. By Sapna Maheshwari FEB. 14, 2018 For advertisers, one of the internet‚Äôs great promises has been the ability to automatically target people based on their interests and demographics, with little regard to the websites they are visiting. But these days, major brands have been forced to rethink how they advertise online. Companies from Kellogg to AT&T have come under fire for inadvertently funding bigotry, hate speech and misinformation, often because they were using automated ad technology to reach groups of people across a vast number of sites and videos. Instead of perfectly polishing their feeds, photographers and brands are now showing what women, in particular, actually look like. By Amanda Hess FEB. 14, 2018 For all the talk about the internet‚Äôs power to democratize the media, Instagram can present an awfully traditional picture of what a woman is supposed to be. The images that rise on the platform are a hellscape of white feminine conformity, with top influencers sporting the same matte lips and contoured cheeks, their bodies whittled and waxed and contorted into the same poses. (Hey, @kyliejenner.) But perfectly polished Instagram feeds have now given way to real ones, in which women in particular are showing what they actually look like. And because they have demanded to be seen, brands have taken notice, too. Advertisement "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By David Brooks Opinion Columnist Once upon a time, power was held in the hands of a small elite. This elite occupied the commanding heights of society and controlled big, top-down organizations. It dropped products and messages from on high, and the rest of us passively consumed them. Then along came the internet. Suddenly, information was dispersed across self-organizing, open-source networks of citizens who had the ability to collaborate, share and shape their world. Hierarchies were smashed, the wisdom of crowd was applied and transparency reigned. O.K. That didn‚Äôt really happen. The first dreams of the tech revolution didn‚Äôt come true. Sometimes it seems power was just redistributed from one set of massive organizations to others ‚Äî Amazon, Facebook, Spotify. But something has changed. We have seen an explosion of new social organisms that don‚Äôt look like the old ones: Airbnb, Etsy, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, Blockchain. If power in the Greatest Generation looked like Organization Men running big institutions, and power for the boomers looked like mass movements organized by charismatic leaders like Steve Jobs and Barack Obama, power these days looks like decentralized networks in which everyone is a leader and there‚Äôs no dominating idol. Power structures are in serious flux. The best window I‚Äôve seen into this new world is a book called ‚ÄúNew Power,‚Äù by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms. Heimans is C.E.O. of Purpose, which supports social movements around the world. Timms is executive director at New York‚Äôs 92nd Street Y, a 144-year-old institution; he also helped create Giving Tuesday, a classic new power movement. Timms thought that after the consumerism of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there should be a day to give back. The normal thing would have been to put the 92nd Street Y logo on the effort and organize charities and other organizations around a consortium. Instead, he and his team established the meme Giving Tuesday, created a web page and some tools for people who wanted to organize, and they let the crowd take over. There are now Giving Tuesday or Giving something organizations in over 100 countries. Local organizers talk directly to one another and reshape the movement as they wish. Even more than technology, what‚Äôs changed is people‚Äôs attitudes toward authority. They don‚Äôt trust it. They want to see people who look like them running things. Any movement that earns legitimacy has to spread ownership around. The Ikea effect applies: People value what they helped build. Many organizations profiled in ‚ÄúNew Power‚Äù are decentralized but have wrestled with the challenges of decentralization, like: How do you establish unity of purpose amid the cacophony of voices? How do you maintain standards of excellence amid the democratization of control? How do you get loosely affiliated people to commit long term, so your movement won‚Äôt fizzle out, the way the Ice Bucket Challenge did? Heimans and Timms emphasize that the best organizations try to blend old and new power structures. These organizations are often founded by what you might call disappearing organizers. Somebody comes up with a compelling concept, like TED or Black Lives Matter. The concept gives people a sticky group identity; many people think of themselves as Tedsters. The core idea is spreadable, actionable and connected ‚Äî it allows participants to subcreate in local and flexible ways. Tedsters organize and attend over 20,000 local TEDx events. The founder doesn‚Äôt dominate the network so much as manage the community. Successful movements create what Marilynn Brewer calls ‚Äúoptimal distinctiveness‚Äù ‚Äî as Heimans and Timms put it, ‚Äúmaking people feel like they are part of it and that they can stand out in it.‚Äù The concepts binding these movements are clear, emotional and concrete and have an implied communal narrative (MeToo). But the successful organizations also feature some structural innovation. They tend to have very low barriers to entry ‚Äî no dues, no loyalty pledge up front. But they have ways to incentivize members up the participation ladder, offering premiums for super-participants who adapt, organize and share. The Lego company sets up special events and an ambassador network for its highly dedicated AFOLs (Adult Fans of Lego). At the Dutch news organization De Correspondent, journalists share story ideas with subscribers before they write them, so they can harvest community knowledge. Heimans and Timms point out that Donald Trump also blends old and new power. He may talk like an authoritarian ‚Äî only I can fix this ‚Äî but his actual campaign structure was a loose network of self-organizing activists. Trump is what they call a ‚Äúplatform strongman‚Äù ‚Äî someone who marshals dispersed participants on behalf of centralizing ends. The last few decades have been a social trust apocalypse. The only remaining bonds of trust are local and particular. But people are ingenious. They are figuring out how to build on those ties to weave and redeem the broader social fabric. I realize my column these days is bipolar, wildly optimistic or pessimistic. But I guess that‚Äôs appropriate, since the forces tearing society apart are powerful and the people bringing it together are, too.

Politics,"Advertisement By NICHOLAS FANDOS, MATT APUZZO and CHARLIE SAVAGENOV. 14, 2017  Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, where he was questioned about campaign contacts with Russians during the 2016 election. ‚Ä¢ Attorney General Jeff Sessions, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, showed selective recall on the Trump campaign‚Äôs Russia contacts. ‚Ä¢ Mr. Sessions said he had ‚Äúno reason to doubt these women‚Äù who have accused the man who wants his old Senate seat, Roy S. Moore, of seeking sexual or romantic favors from them as teenagers. ‚Ä¢ Mr. Sessions was asked about his direction that the department consider a special counsel to investigate Mr. Trump‚Äôs political opponents, including Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sessions denied that he lied in October when he testified that he knew of nobody in the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt believe it happened,‚Äù he said. Advertisement Court records later revealed that Mr. Sessions led a March 2016 meeting in which George Papadopoulos, a campaign aide, discussed his Russian ties and suggested setting up a meeting between Mr. Trump. and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. ‚ÄúI had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports,‚Äù Mr. Sessions said. Mr. Sessions testified Tuesday that was still hazy on the details about what Mr. Papadopoulos had proposed. Advertisement But on one matter, he said his memory is clear: he said he shot down Mr. Papadopoulos‚Äô idea of a Trump-Putin meeting. And he said he told Mr. Papadopoulos that he was not authorized to represent the campaign in such discussions. To sum up: Mr. Sessions said he could not remember much about Russian influence on the Trump campaign, except when he could block such influence. As Democrats repeatedly put heat on Mr. Sessions over the evolution of his testimony before Congress, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, invoked an unexpected ostensible ally: Senator Jeff Sessions. Holding up a speech he said Mr. Sessions had given on the Senate floor during the proceedings to remove President Bill Clinton from office, Mr. Jeffries said Mr. Sessions had then justified his vote for removal by saying that he would not hold the president to a different standard than a young police officer he had prosecuted years before for lying under oath. ‚ÄúYou stated that you refused to hold a president accountable to a different standard than the young police officer who you prosecuted,‚Äù Mr. Jeffries said. ‚ÄúLet me be clear: The attorney general of the United States of America should not be held to a different standard than the young police officer whose life you ruined by prosecuting him for perjury.‚Äù Mr. Sessions vehemently disagreed with the comparison, repeatedly calling Mr. Jeffries suggestion ‚Äúunfair.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúMr. Jeffries, nobody, nobody, not you or anyone else should be prosecuted, not be accused of perjury for answering the question the way I did in this hearing,‚Äù Mr. Sessions said. ‚ÄúI have always tried to answer the questions fairly and accurately.‚Äù Several Republican lawmakers urged Mr. Sessions to crack down on leaks. Republicans have generally responded to various Trump-Russia revelations ‚Äî like the Washington Post report disclosing that a wiretap of the Russian ambassador had picked up his conversations about sanctions with Michael Flynn, then Mr. Trump‚Äôs national security adviser ‚Äî by saying the real scandal was the leaks. Mr. Sessions told Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the committee, that the leaking of classified information was ‚Äúa very grave offense.‚Äù He also said touted a significant increase in the number of open leak investigations. ‚ÄúWe had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years; we have 27 investigations open today,‚Äù Mr. Sessions said. ‚ÄúWe intend to get to the bottom of these leaks. I think it has reached epidemic proportions. It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continue.‚Äù In August, Mr. Sessions had told reporters that the Justice Department was pursuing three times the number of leak investigations as were open at the end of the Obama administration, but he had declined then to say what the specific numbers were. (The numbers were also complicated by the fact that the department‚Äôs method of tracking such cases conflates leaks to the news media with other types of unauthorized disclosures, like foreign espionage. Mr. Sessions said in August, and again on Tuesday, that there have been four such indictments this year, but only one of those ‚Äî the charging of Reality Leigh Winner, a contractor working for the N.S.A., with sending an intelligence report about Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election to The Intercept ‚Äî is a classic news media leak case.) Later, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, brought up Mr. Trump‚Äôs accusation that the press is the ‚Äúenemy of the people,‚Äù said the Founders thought the free press was society‚Äôs best friend, and asked Mr. Sessions to commit to not prosecuting ‚Äúinvestigative journalists for maintaining the confidentiality of their professional sources.‚Äù (That question garbled or conflated two different issues. One is whether journalists could be jailed for contempt if they refuse to provide witness testimony when subpoenaed in connection with an investigation into or prosecution of their suspected sources. The other is whether journalists could be prosecuted as alleged co-conspirators in a criminal leak.) Advertisement ‚ÄúI‚Äôll commit to respecting the role of the press and conducting my office in a way that respects that,‚Äù Mr. Sessions responded. ‚ÄúWe have not had a conflict in my term in office yet with the press but there are some things the press seems to think they have an absolute right to.‚Äù but it does not, he added. He offered no further details about where he draws the line. While the Trump campaign contacts with Russia is the main recurring theme, a separate subplot has emerged: surveillance. The statute by which Congress legalized the Bush administration‚Äôs post-9/11 warrantless wiretapping program, Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, is set to expire at the end of 2017 if lawmakers do not extend it. The current law permits the government to collect from American internet companies, without a warrant, the messages of foreigners abroad who have been targeted for intelligence purposes ‚Äî even when they are communicating with an American. Leaders from both parties on the House Judiciary Committee have agreed to push a bill, dubbed the USA Liberty Act, that would impose some new limitations on the surveillance program as a condition of extending it. The Liberty Act would require government agents to obtain a warrant from a judge to scrutinize such messages when the information pertains to Americans connected to a criminal investigation, though not when it comes to a national-security investigation. The Trump administration opposes that idea. Among others, Rep. Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Sessions about that issue. Invoking the language of Fourth Amendment privacy rights, he noted that the information in the internet repository was seized without a warrant, and said querying the database amounts to a search. He demanded, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt think probable cause and a warrant is required to go into that information?‚Äù Mr. Sessions replied that the federal courts ‚Äúhave so held,‚Äù adding ‚ÄúI agree with the courts, not you, congressman, on that.‚Äù In fact, while it is true that several judges have upheld the use of evidence derived from the program in terrorism-related cases; the issue of whether evidence derived from it may be used in ordinary criminal cases ‚Äî the type the Liberty Act proposal addresses ‚Äî has not been adjudicated. Advertisement Mr. Poe responded: ‚ÄúIt is the responsibility of Congress to set the privacy standard for Americans.‚Äù The Constitution supports the view that the government should get a warrant before it searches through internet databases without a warrant, he said. Otherwise, ‚Äúthat is spying on Americans.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

Moore of seeking sex or romance with them when they were teenagers. Mr. Moore is seeking to fill the Alabama Senate seat that Mr. Sessions gave up when he was confirmed as attorney general. And Mr. Sessions remains a popular figure in Alabama. The attorney general‚Äôs views matter in his home state. What‚Äôs more, Republican leaders in Washington are discussing whether Mr. Sessions should launch a write-in campaign to reclaim his seat. If that does not happen and Mr. Moore prevails in the Dec. 12 special election, there is talk of expelling the jurist from the Senate and prevailing on Alabama‚Äôs governor, Kay Ivey, to appoint Mr. Sessions back to the Senate. Mr. Sessions‚Äô appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was really a twofer. There was the hearing on the Trump campaign‚Äôs contacts with Russia, guided by the committee‚Äôs Democrats who single-mindedly bored in on the topic. Then there was the hearing-on-any-topic-other-than-Russia orchestrated by the committee‚Äôs Republicans, which scurried over federal eavesdropping law, rising crime, immigration and Hillary Clinton. Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, summed up the Republican sentiment. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt speak Russian and I haven‚Äôt met with Russians and I don‚Äôt really want to talk about that today,‚Äù he said, before diving into questions about sober living homes. The Democrats were not exclusively concerned with Russia. During his time with the attorney general, Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, paused the grilling to ask Mr. Sessions about a subject long associated with him: pot. Comedy ensued. Advertisement ‚ÄúYou said one time that good people don‚Äôt smoke marijuana,‚Äù Mr. Cohen said. ‚ÄúWhich of these people would you say are not good people?‚Äù Mr. Sessions began to explain in earnest, but Mr. Cohen cut him off. ‚ÄúQuickly. John Kasich, a good person? George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Judge Clarence Thomas ‚Äî which are not good people?‚Äù he demanded, citing prominent Republicans who, ostensibly, have admitted smoking dope. Mr. Sessions, laughing with much of the hearing room, chalked it up to context. ‚ÄúSo the question was, what do you do about drug use, the epidemic we‚Äôre seeing in the country, and how you reverse it. Part of that is a cultural thing. I explained how when I became the United States attorney in 1981, and the drugs were being used widely, over a period of years, it became unfashionable, unpopular, and people were seeing ‚Äî it was seen as such that good people didn‚Äôt use marijuana.‚Äù And with that, Mr. Cohen‚Äôs allotted time for questioning ended. The White House was carefully watching Mr. Sessions‚Äôs performance. The attorney general has been in hot water with the president since he decided in March to recuse himself from all matters related to Russia, leaving him without control over the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the election. Representative Robert Goodlatte, the committee‚Äôs Republican chairman, appeared to pile on when he said, ‚ÄúWhile I understand your decision to recuse yourself was an effort by you to do the right thing, I believe you, as a person of integrity, would have been impartial and fair in following the facts wherever they led.‚Äù Any hiccups in Mr. Sessions‚Äôs testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worse. And Representative John Conyers, the top Democrat on the panel, did not make things easier for the attorney general when he asked Mr. Sessions if the president should make ‚Äúpublic comments that might influence a pending criminal investigation.‚Äù Mr. Sessions hesitated. ‚ÄúHe should take great care in those issues,‚Äù he said, before adding a defense of Mr. Trump. Advertisement ‚ÄúI would say it‚Äôs improper,‚Äù Mr. Sessions said. ‚ÄúA president cannot improperly influence an investigation. And I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced.‚Äù Republicans were pleased that Mr. Sessions came with good news. On Monday, the Justice Department notified the committee that senior prosecutors were looking into whether a special counsel should be appointed to investigate the Obama administration‚Äôs decision to allow a Russian nuclear agency to buy Uranium One, a company that owned access to uranium in the United States. The department will also examine whether any donations to the Clinton Foundation were tied to the approval. Republicans are investigating the matter themselves but have been clamoring for the department to get involved. On Tuesday, Mr. Goodlatte signaled his support but said again that he wanted the department to go farther and appoint a second special counsel. He also urged Mr. Sessions to let a special counsel investigate the Clinton email case. ‚ÄúThere are significant concerns that the partisanship of the F.B.I. and the department has weakened the ability of each to act objectively,‚Äù he said. Democrats were incensed by the letter, which they said they did not receive. Mr. Conyers said the appointment of a new special counsel was merely to ‚Äúcater to the President‚Äôs political needs.‚Äù He argued that there was not sufficient evidence to do so. And, he said, it smacked of ‚Äúa banana republic.‚Äù Mr. Sessions said that any decisions about the investigations would be made ‚Äúwithout regard to politics, ideology, or bias.‚Äù Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, pressed Mr. Sessions on a litany of issues that ‚Äúlooks like‚Äù they need a special counsel to investigate, the attorney general was brusque: ‚Äú ‚ÄòLooks like‚Äô is not enough to appoint a special counsel.‚Äù Mr. Sessions has twice told lawmakers under oath that as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign, he did not communicate with Russians to aid Mr. Trump‚Äôs candidacy, nor did he know of other members of the campaign who had. Advertisement His challenge on Tuesday will be to try to square those comments with recent revelations that at least one member of the campaign‚Äôs foreign policy council, which Mr. Sessions led, and another foreign policy adviser, had informed Mr. Sessions about their discussions with Russians at the time. Mr. Sessions has already had his statements undercut once. After telling senators at his confirmation hearing in January that he had not had any contacts with Russians, it was revealed that Mr. Sessions held multiple meetings with a Russian ambassador during the campaign. Now, Mr. Sessions must contend with comments he made last month, in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. ‚ÄúI did not, and I‚Äôm not aware of anyone else that did,‚Äù Mr. Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with Russians. Democrats on the committee put Mr. Sessions on alert in a letter last week, saying that they would want clarification on ‚Äúinconsistencies‚Äù between those statements and those of the two campaign advisers, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who have acknowledged having contact with Russians. ‚ÄúUnder oath, knowing in advance that he would be asked about this subject, the Attorney General gave answers that were, at best, incomplete,‚Äù said Mr. Conyers. ‚ÄúI hope the Attorney General can provide some clarification on this problem in his remarks today.‚Äù Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.

Politics,"Advertisement By MARK LANDLERMARCH 20, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump called on Tuesday to congratulate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on his re-election, but did not raise with him the lopsided nature of his victory, Russia‚Äôs meddling in the 2016 presidential election or Moscow‚Äôs role in a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter living in Britain. Instead, Mr. Trump kept the focus of the call on what the White House said were ‚Äúshared interests‚Äù ‚Äî among them, North Korea and Ukraine ‚Äî overruling his national security advisers, who had urged him to raise Russia‚Äôs recent behavior. ‚ÄúWe had a very good call,‚Äù Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, where he had just welcomed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúWe will probably be meeting in the not-too-distant future.‚Äù The president‚Äôs upbeat characterization came five days after his administration imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election and for other ‚Äúmalicious cyberattacks,‚Äù the most significant action it has taken against Moscow since Mr. Trump took office. The United States also joined Britain, France and Germany in denouncing the Russian government for violating international law for the attack on the spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter Yulia. Advertisement Both actions highlighted a contradiction at the heart of the Trump presidency: the administration‚Äôs steadily tougher stance toward Russia and Mr. Trump‚Äôs own stubborn reluctance to criticize Mr. Putin. Advertisement Mr. Trump, a senior official said, signed off on the sanctions and the harsh language in the administration‚Äôs statements. But he was determined not to antagonize Mr. Putin, this person said, because he believes his leader-to-leader rapport is the only way to improve relations between the two countries. That strategy has put Mr. Trump at odds with his own advisers: in preparing the president for the call, aides advised him to raise the nerve-agent attack and wrote on his briefing materials, ‚ÄúDO NOT CONGRATULATE.‚Äù The Washington Post first reported these details. A second official, however, said that while Mr. Trump‚Äôs briefing cards did contain those suggestions, he spoke to his aides by phone and never saw the cards. The White House also insisted that it was not the place of the United States to question how other countries conduct their elections ‚Äî a contention that is at odds with years of critical statements about foreign elections by the United States, as well as recent statements by the Trump administration about elections in Venezuela and Iran. ‚ÄúWhat we do know is that Putin has been elected in their country, and that‚Äôs not something we can dictate to them how they operate,‚Äù said the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ‚ÄúWe can only focus on the freeness and fairness of our elections, something we 100 percent fully support.‚Äù Echoing the president, she went on to rail against the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. ‚ÄúTo pretend like going through this absurd process for over a year would not bring frustration seems a little bit ridiculous,‚Äù she said. Advertisement Ms. Sanders noted that other foreign leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, of Germany, had called Mr. Putin. Ms. Merkel‚Äôs office released a terse account of their call, saying she had told the Russian president, ‚ÄúToday, it is more important than ever to continue the dialogue with one another and to foster relations between our states and peoples.‚Äù Republican lawmakers, even those who have resisted criticizing Mr. Trump, faulted him for congratulating Mr. Putin. ‚ÄúWhen I look at a Russian election, what I see is a lack of credibility in tallying the results,‚Äù said the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ‚ÄúCalling him wouldn‚Äôt have been high on my list.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was harsher. ‚ÄúAn American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúAnd by doing so with Vladimir Putin, President Trump insulted every Russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country‚Äôs future, including the countless Russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist Putin‚Äôs regime.‚Äù In fact, both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush called to congratulate Mr. Putin after previous election victories. In Mr. Obama‚Äôs case, said Michael A. McFaul, who served as ambassador to Moscow during the Obama administration, there was lively internal debate about whether, and when, the president should make that call. Mr. Obama waited several days after Mr. Putin‚Äôs election in March 2012 before calling. After that election, the State Department issued a statement in which it said, ‚ÄúThe United States congratulates the Russian people on the completion of the presidential elections, and looks forward to working with the president-elect after the results are certified and he is sworn in.‚Äù The language, Mr. McFaul said, was carefully chosen to applaud the Russian people for voting without praising Mr. Putin for winning. The statement also noted the reservations of outside observers about the ‚Äúpartisan use of government resources, and procedural irregularities on Election Day,‚Äù though it credited the Russian authorities for reforms after a widely criticized parliamentary election the previous December. The parliamentary election drew condemnation from Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, who said the Russian people, ‚Äúlike people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted.‚Äù Her statement planted the seeds for the antipathy between her and Mr. Putin, who accused her of fomenting unrest in Russia. Advertisement This time, Mr. Putin prevailed with more than 76 percent of the vote. International observers said Russian electoral authorities counted the votes efficiently, but that several other factors prevented the contest from being fair. ‚ÄúRestrictions on the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as well as on candidate registration, have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine competition,‚Äù observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report. During their call on Tuesday, a senior official said, Mr. Trump told Mr. Putin he had been concerned by a recent speech in which Mr. Putin talked about Russia developing an ‚Äúinvincible‚Äù intercontinental cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo that could outsmart all American defenses. Mr. Putin‚Äôs presentation included animated videos depicting multiple warheads aimed at Florida, where the president often stays at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Mr. Trump raised the nuclear threat in calls with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Ms. Merkel. More recently, however, Mr. Trump noted that Mr. Putin had taken a more moderate tone, talking about the need to de-escalate the nuclear arms race between Russia and the United States. Mr. Trump, this official said, told Mr. Putin that he welcomed the shift in tone. But Mr. Trump reminded Mr. Putin that his administration was spending $700 billion to upgrade the American military, and that the United States would win any arms race between the two. ‚ÄúWe will never allow anybody to have anything even close to what we have,‚Äù Mr. Trump told reporters.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Nicholas Fandos and Sharon LaFraniere WASHINGTON ‚Äî Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee declared in a 250-page report on Friday that their yearlong investigation uncovered no evidence that the Trump campaign had aided Russia‚Äôs election meddling, only ill-advised contacts between campaign aides and Russian officials or their intermediaries. The Republicans took aim at what they called the misjudgments of Democrats and others even as they sought to play down the seriousness of mistakes by or suspicions about Donald J. Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. They faulted aides to Hillary Clinton for secretly paying for opposition research that included information from Russian sources, and castigated federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies for failing to counter Russian interference as well as for purported investigative abuses and allegedly damaging national security leaks. In a nearly 100-page dissenting document, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee described the Republicans‚Äô report as little more than a whitewash. The eagerness of Trump campaign aides to accept offers of Russian assistance, they said, suggests ‚Äúa consciousness of wrongfulness, if not illegality.‚Äù The Democrats complained that the committee failed to pursue obvious leads, interview important witnesses or investigate crucial lines of inquiry. The opposing conclusions closed a tumultuous chapter for a congressional committee that is charged with oversight of American spy agencies, but fractured into warring camps whose primary mission often seemed to be advancing their own political agendas. The results diminished hopes that Congress, which has mounted two similar investigations, is likely to get to the bottom of Russia‚Äôs attempts to influence the election. [Read the report.] In the charged political climate that has engulfed Washington, Mr. Trump and his allies immediately seized on the Republicans‚Äô report ‚Äî the first by a government body ‚Äî as a useful political tool against continuing investigations, including that of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The president extolled the Republicans‚Äô conclusions on Twitter, saying the entire investigative effort, involving interviews with dozens of witnesses and the review of hundreds of pages of documents, had been nothing but ‚Äúa total Witch Hunt!‚Äù ‚ÄúMUST END NOW!‚Äù he added. He later told reporters in the Oval Office he was ‚Äúhonored‚Äù by the report. While the bulk of the Republican document covered familiar ground, it contained intriguing new details about interactions between Russian officials or intermediaries and Trump associates, including Michael T. Flynn, who served briefly as Mr. Trump‚Äôs national security adviser. It disclosed, for example, that before traveling to Moscow in December 2015, Mr. Flynn and his son met privately with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, at his Washington residence. Mr. Flynn‚Äôs son later emailed the Russian Embassy that the meeting had been ‚Äúvery productive.‚Äù In a newly disclosed June 2016 email, Mr. Flynn also seemed to give a Trump campaign aide a preview of the release of stolen emails that would prove highly damaging to the Clinton campaign. ‚ÄúThere are a number of things happening (and will happen) this election via cyber operations (by both hacktivists, nation states and the DNC),‚Äù he wrote to an unnamed communications adviser. Mr. Flynn sent that email after disclosures that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russian operatives but before WikiLeaks began releasing the stolen emails. But the committee never interviewed Mr. Flynn, who has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador during the transition and is now cooperating with Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team. For the most part, the Republicans cast communications between Trump associates and Russian officials or intermediaries as simply misguided. ‚ÄúWhile the committee found that several of the contacts between Trump associates and Russians ‚Äî or their proxies, including WikiLeaks ‚Äî were ill advised, the committee did not determine that Trump or anyone associated with him assisted Russia‚Äôs active-measures campaign,‚Äù the Republicans wrote. In one finding ‚Äî mocked by the Democrats as particularly convoluted ‚Äî the Republicans asserted that ‚Äúpossible Russian efforts to set up a ‚Äòback channel‚Äô with Trump associates after the election‚Äù indicated campaign officials did not collude with Russians because otherwise a back channel would have already existed. The Republicans criticized the Obama administration for a ‚Äúslow and inconsistent‚Äù response to Russia‚Äôs covert interference. They faulted the F.B.I. for failing to properly notify victims of Russian hacking and for obtaining a warrant to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. They also said that American officials should have warned the Trump campaign about Mr. Page‚Äôs ties to Russia, even though Mr. Page was under investigation by the F.B.I. at the time and such a disclosure would have been highly unusual. Even the Republicans, however, raised questions about Mr. Page‚Äôs Russia trip in July 2016. Although Mr. Page did not represent the campaign on that trip, the lawmakers said, ‚Äúthe committee is concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his activity in Moscow.‚Äù The Republicans accused the intelligence agencies of failing to use ‚Äúproper analytic tradecraft‚Äù as they crafted a key conclusion of a January 2017 assessment of the Russian campaign. In the portion in question, intelligence officials had concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted to harm Mrs. Clinton and aid Mr. Trump. The Republican report does not explicitly contest that conclusion but implies that the Russians‚Äô primary intention was to sow discord, not to help Mr. Trump. And they admonished Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign and the Democratic National Committee for hiring Fusion GPS, a research firm, to investigate ties between Trump associates and Russia. The firm in turn hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, who produced a salacious dossier outlining a conspiracy between the campaign and the Russians based, in part, on Russian sources. ‚ÄúThey were very forceful in saying that the Clinton campaign actually did contribute to Russia, so maybe somebody ought to look at that,‚Äù Mr. Trump said at the White House, underscoring the political opportunity the report handed him. ‚ÄúBut what we really should do is get on with our lives.‚Äù Democrats accused the Republicans of ‚Äúoften risible attempts to explain away inconvenient truths‚Äù while turning a blind eye to obvious leads. For example, the Democrats were eager to determine whether in June 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had called his father to discuss his coming meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who was supposed to deliver dirt on Mrs. Clinton. But they said that Republicans stymied their efforts to obtain the phone records for the president while he was a candidate, so a call from Donald Trump Jr. to a blocked number remained a mystery. ‚ÄúThe pattern of deception surrounding these meetings ‚Äî first denying they took place; then, when discovered, denying their content; and then denying their significance ‚Äî suggests a consciousness of wrongfulness, if not illegality,‚Äù the Democrats wrote of the Trump campaign. They complained that the Republicans refused to expand the investigation to look at whether the president or his aides had obstructed justice or abused their power, despite ‚Äúimportant evidence‚Äù before the committee. The Democrats also disputed the Republicans‚Äô claims about the January 2017 intelligence assessment. They said that the Republicans cited no evidence to support their claim of improper tradecraft and that Democrats‚Äô own review showed that the analysis met standards. Information that has become public since has only clarified Mr. Putin‚Äôs intention to help Mr. Trump, they said. They also dismissed an assertion by Republicans that Mr. Trump‚Äôs business dealings with Russia before the 2016 campaign provided no basis for collusion. The Republicans would have no way of reaching such a conclusion, they Democrats said, because they never studied Mr. Trump‚Äôs pre-campaign business dealings. The lawmakers split deeply over whether James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, had leaked sensitive information to the news media. Republicans said Mr. Clapper gave ‚Äúinconsistent testimony‚Äù about his contacts with a reporter about Mr. Steele‚Äôs dossier; Democrats accused Republicans of trying to ‚Äúsmear‚Äù Mr. Clapper without a shred of evidence. Republicans had released key findings from the report in March. The full report, heavily redacted by the intelligence agencies, includes recommendations on issues as diverse as cyber and election security, as well as a call for the executive branch to consider administering mandatory polygraph tests to political appointees with top-secret security clearances unless they are confirmed by the Senate. Though they absolved the Trump campaign, the Republicans warned that Mr. Putin‚Äôs government would be back unless the United States mounted significant efforts to deter his agents. ‚ÄúUnless the cost-benefit equation of such operations changes significantly, the Putin regime and other hostile governments will continue to pursue these attacks against the United States and its allies,‚Äù they wrote. On that point, the Democrats agreed. Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Mark Mazzetti and Charlie Savage contributed reporting. Follow Nicholas Fandos and Sharon LaFraniere: @npfandos and @SharonLNYT.

Politics,"Advertisement By PETER BAKERAPRIL 16, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump rejected, for now at least, a fresh round of sanctions set to be imposed against Russia on Monday, a course change that underscored the schism between the president and his national security team. The president‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, had announced on Sunday that the administration would place sanctions on Russian companies found to be assisting Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons program. The sanctions were listed on a menu of further government options after an American-led airstrike on Syria, retaliating against a suspected gas attack that killed dozens a week earlier. But the White House contradicted her on Monday, saying that Mr. Trump had not approved additional measures. ‚ÄúWe are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future,‚Äù Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. Advertisement Speaking later with reporters aboard Air Force One as Mr. Trump headed to Florida, Ms. Sanders added that ‚Äúthe president has been clear that he‚Äôs going to be tough on Russia, but at the same time he‚Äôd still like to have a good relationship with them.‚Äù Advertisement Another White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said Mr. Trump had decided not to go forward with the sanctions. Mr. Trump concluded that they were unnecessary because Moscow‚Äôs response to the airstrike was mainly bluster, the official said. Russia analysts said the whipsaw policy shift once again highlighted an administration struggling to find a coherent and consistent voice in dealing with Russia, which in the past four years has annexed Crimea, intervened in eastern Ukraine, sought to influence the American election in 2016, allegedly poisoned a former Russian spy living in Britain and propped up the murderous government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Mr. Trump has mostly spoken hopefully of his efforts to forge a friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, including congratulating him on a re-election widely denounced as a sham and even suggesting a White House meeting. At the same time, the Trump administration has imposed two rounds of sanctions against Russia in the last month, expelled 60 of Moscow‚Äôs diplomats and closed a consulate in retaliation for the poisoning attack in Britain. ‚ÄúTrump seems to think that if he accepts what his advisers recommend on even days of the month and rejects their recommendations on odd days, the result will be a strategy,‚Äù said Stephen Sestanovich, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations and Columbia University who served as ambassador to former Soviet states in the 1990s. ‚ÄúBy and large, other governments don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry at all this,‚Äù Mr. Sestanovich said. ‚ÄúBut in Russia, laughter is getting the upper hand.‚Äù Mr. Trump was annoyed with Ms. Haley for getting out in front of the policy, the administration official said, and the president‚Äôs decision to reject sanctions left her hanging in public with her credibility on the line. Ms. Haley has been one of the strongest critics in the administration of Russia‚Äôs behavior around the world, often speaking far more harshly than Mr. Trump would, but she has rarely been reined in publicly this way. She made no comment on Monday. Advertisement Administration officials said new sanctions could still be imposed at some point if Russia takes further action justifying them. But absent such a scenario, the officials could not explain how Mr. Trump would make Russia pay a ‚Äúbig price‚Äù for enabling Syria‚Äôs use of chemical weapons, as he promised to do last week after a suspected gas attack killed more than 40 people and sickened scores more outside Damascus on April 7. The strike against Syria that Mr. Trump announced late Friday in Washington was limited to a single night and to three targets linked to chemical weapons facilities. It sought to punish President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for the suspected gas attack but avoid provoking Russia into a response. Russian forces stationed in Syria have helped Mr. Assad gain the upper hand in the country‚Äôs seven-year civil war.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Russia responded harshly to the news of sanctions before learning that Mr. Trump had canceled them. ‚ÄúThe sanctions drive against Russia is becoming an obsession,‚Äù Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters at his daily briefing in Moscow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre convinced that any economist can see open attempts to squeeze Russian companies out of global markets.‚Äù Critics said the president‚Äôs decision not to follow through on Ms. Haley‚Äôs announcement would sap American authority around the world. ‚ÄúI am outraged that President Trump pulled back sanctions on Russia for its support of the Assad regime,‚Äù said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ‚ÄúThis sends a message to governments around the world that they can support brutal, criminal behavior without serious consequences. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is out of step with the American people, American values ‚Äî and as this situation has made clear, his own administration,‚Äù Mr. Engel said. The about-face on sanctions came a day after ABC News broadcast an interview with James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump last year, in which he said he thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs possible‚Äù that the president had been compromised by Russia. A protester waiting for Mr. Trump in Florida on Monday held a large banner that read, ‚ÄúRussian stooge.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Trump has heatedly and repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia during his 2016 campaign, calling such suggestions a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù perpetrated by Democratic sore losers desperate to explain an election defeat. Russia did not respond militarily to the Friday strike, but American officials noted a sharp spike in Russian online activity around the time it was launched. A snapshot on Friday night recorded a 2,000 percent increase in citing the hashtag #isupportsyria on Russian troll networks, according to a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security who was not authorized to discuss the issue by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Additionally, the official said, the known Russian hashtag #SyriaStrikes had a 4,443 percent increase in activity while another, #Damsucs, saw a 2,800 percent jump. In hitting the Barzah Research and Development Center, a chemical weapons research lab in greater Damascus, and two storage facilities and bunkers near Homs, Pentagon officials insisted that they dealt a critical blow to Mr. Assad‚Äôs weapons program. But Friday night‚Äôs strike, delivered via 105 missiles, was not quite double the 59 missiles used last year when Mr. Trump ordered the military to strike a Syrian airfield from which planes engaged in another chemical weapons attack took off. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed hard to limit the strikes to proven weapons facilities in the hopes that a more limited strike would not prompt retaliation from Russia. The lab at Barzah, in Damascus, was on the receiving end of the biggest barrage ‚Äî some 76 missiles, a combination of Tomahawk cruise missiles and Joint air-to-surface missiles. The rest of the bombs ‚Äî 29, fired by American, French and British warplanes ‚Äî struck and destroyed the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility near Homs, and the Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker facility around five miles away. Syria tried to hit back, but by the time its air defense system was deployed, the American warplanes were on their way home and the war ships had completed their mission, military officials said. They disputed Syrian claims to have shot down dozens of American missiles. ‚ÄúWe assess that over 40 surface-to-air missiles were employed by the Syrian regime,‚Äù Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, told reporters on Saturday. ‚ÄúMost of these launches occurred after the last impact of our strike was over.‚Äù He called the Syrian retaliatory missiles ‚Äúlargely ineffective‚Äù and said they ‚Äúclearly increased risk to their own people based on their indiscriminate response ‚Äî when you shoot iron into the sky without guidance, it will inevitably fall to earth.‚Äù An earlier version of this article, relying on information provided by a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, referred incorrectly to an increase of Russian online trolling activity that occurred on the same day as airstrikes against Syria. The increase was noted among Russian hashtags, not bots. Additionally, the information should not have been attributed to the department‚Äôs spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton. Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow and Helene Cooper and Ron Nixon from Washington.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michael S. Schmidt and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON ‚Äî The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to President Trump‚Äôs businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president. The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that encompasses Mr. Trump‚Äôs business ventures. Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over records related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said. The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will continue for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena came as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his inquiry to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump‚Äôs political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States. Mr. Mueller has already indicted 13 Russians and three companies accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, and on Thursday, the Trump administration included them in sanctions it leveled at Moscow as punishment for interference in the campaign and ‚Äúmalicious cyberattacks.‚Äù The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller‚Äôs order. ‚ÄúSince July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and is responding to their requests,‚Äù said Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization. ‚ÄúThis is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.‚Äù The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated during her daily briefing that the president was cooperating with the special counsel inquiry and referred further questions to the Trump Organization. There are few other publicly known examples of Mr. Mueller using subpoenas. In January, he ordered the president‚Äôs former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, to appear before a grand jury. Mr. Mueller dropped the subpoena after Mr. Bannon agreed to be interviewed by investigators. Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump‚Äôs business outside ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family‚Äôs finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line. Mr. Trump campaigned as a businessman whose deal-making prowess would translate directly into reforming Washington. The argument helped propel him to the White House, but the Trump Organization has been a magnet for criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and some Republicans, who expressed concern that he remained vulnerable to conflicts of interest because he did not separate from the company. Before Mr. Trump was sworn in, he pledged that he would stay uninvolved in his businesses while in office but insisted it would be too punitive for his business partners for him to divest from the company altogether. Among the Trump Organization‚Äôs holdings are golf clubs, hotels and licensing agreements for the use of the Trump name on properties and other products. While its holdings are complex, the company has always been run like a small, family-owned business; Mr. Trump brought in his three eldest children to help run the enterprise. The Trump Organization is not publicly held, making it difficult to determine where it receives its money and invests it. The company has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow. In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump‚Äôs, Felix Sater, emailed Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign. Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 and discussed it at least three times with Mr. Cohen. A revealing comment about Russia by Eric Trump, the president‚Äôs middle son, also drew scrutiny when it emerged last year. James Dodson, a longtime golf writer from North Carolina, said offhand in a radio interview that Eric Trump, who oversees the golf courses for the Trump Organization, told him in 2013 that the Trumps relied on Russian investors to back their golf clubs. Eric Trump has denied those remarks. Mr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry. A month later, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation. Mr. Mueller is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation. Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview, but the president has said he wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators‚Äô questions. At the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel‚Äôs investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet T. Flood, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during the impeachment process, about coming into the White House to deal with the inquiry. Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Mike McIntire contributed reporting from New York.

Instead of perfectly polishing their feeds, photographers and brands are now showing what women, in particular, actually look like. By Amanda Hess FEB. 14, 2018 For all the talk about the internet‚Äôs power to democratize the media, Instagram can present an awfully traditional picture of what a woman is supposed to be. The images that rise on the platform are a hellscape of white feminine conformity, with top influencers sporting the same matte lips and contoured cheeks, their bodies whittled and waxed and contorted into the same poses. (Hey, @kyliejenner.) But perfectly polished Instagram feeds have now given way to real ones, in which women in particular are showing what they actually look like. And because they have demanded to be seen, brands have taken notice, too. The internet was born in text. Now, video and audio are ascendant, writing is being left behind, and everything will be different. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 I‚Äôll make this short: The thing you‚Äôre doing now, reading prose on a screen, is going out of fashion. We‚Äôre taking stock of the internet right now, with writers who cover the digital world cataloging some of the most consequential currents shaping it. If you probe those currents and look ahead to the coming year online, one truth becomes clear. The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text, and the exploding reach and power of audio and video. The distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan have closed. Now simple, guttural digital messages, often with multimedia, are big in politics. By Nellie Bowles FEB. 14, 2018 Political memes have gone mainstream as the distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan has closed. President Trump has frequently retweeted his fans‚Äô meme work, #MeToo jumped from social media to every workplace, and political campaigns started to invest in the form more seriously. The political meme ‚Äî text over an image, sometimes short videos or digital clip art meant to spread and be imitated ‚Äî is often a guttural, simple message couched in humor, like the doctored video from September of Hillary Clinton being hit with his golf ball. There are now more ways to tell if your tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because of the ratio. By Mike Isaac FEB. 14, 2018 It‚Äôs easy to tell when you‚Äôve nailed a good tweet ‚Äî just watch the likes and retweets pile up as the post goes viral. Now there are also more ways to tell if a tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because a new barometer for Twitter blahness has taken hold: the ratio. It‚Äôs harder to ignore harassment, or retaliate against accusers, when reports are bolstered by the stories of many others and the public is watching. By Claire Cain Miller FEB. 14, 2018 Susan Fowler had tried going to human resources. She had tried going to her managers. She had tried transferring departments. But nothing changed. The sexual and sexist comments she received as an engineer at Uber kept coming. So she went online and wrote a 3,000-word blog post exposing the behavior. The pioneers of social media have begun grumbling that their technology might be irresistible. But they have few ideas about how to tame the beast they built. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 Your phone buzzes. A message, an Instagram post, a tweet ‚Äî some bit of digital effluvia has come in, and it‚Äôs right there, promising a brief but necessary hit of connection. All you have to do is look. But, just as an experiment, how long can you resist looking? A minute? Two? If you make it that long, how do you start to feel? Can you concentrate? Does your mind wander at what you‚Äôre missing? And if you give in ‚Äî as you surely will, as you probably do many times a day ‚Äî how do you feel about yourself? Major companies have been forced to rethink how they advertise online after coming under fire when their digital ads appeared next to racist or fake-news content. By Sapna Maheshwari FEB. 14, 2018 For advertisers, one of the internet‚Äôs great promises has been the ability to automatically target people based on their interests and demographics, with little regard to the websites they are visiting. But these days, major brands have been forced to rethink how they advertise online. Companies from Kellogg to AT&T have come under fire for inadvertently funding bigotry, hate speech and misinformation, often because they were using automated ad technology to reach groups of people across a vast number of sites and videos.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press MILWAUKEE ‚Äî The Milwaukee Bucks' coaching search is underway, with interviews starting as early as this weekend. ""For us we're on a really thought-out process,"" general manager Jon Horst said Friday. ""It will start out immediately and we'll hopefully get to a great result at the end of it."" Current coach Joe Prunty will be among those interviewed after the former assistant led the Bucks to a 21-16 record following the firing in late January of Jason Kidd. The Bucks said then that Prunty would get a shot to keep the job. ""Joe has earned the right to be part of this process. He will be,"" Horst said at the Bucks' training facility. ""Now it's our job to not only focus on Joe but the other candidates that we're going to bring in and try to come up with a great result."" The Bucks' job is attractive with a new arena opening in the fall and budding NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo leading a young core. Interviews could start as early as Saturday, Horst said, and there was no timeline to make a hire. Teams are also preparing for the NBA draft on June 21, and free agency begins July 1. ""So we'd like to have someone in place in a timely manner, but we're not going to rush a decision ... at the end of the day, we'll take as a long we need to take the right person,"" Horst said. The Bucks took a small step forward this year after winning 44 games, two better than last year. They were eliminated in seven games in the first round of the playoffs by the Boston Celtics, a year after losing in six in the first to Toronto. Forward Jabari Parker returned in early February from the second major left knee of his career. About the same time, key guards Malcolm Brogdon (quad) and Matthew Dellavedova (ankle) went down with injuries that forced them to miss of the last two months of the year. Milwaukee adjusted to the arrival of guard Eric Bledsoe by trade from Phoenix in November, along with the firing of Kidd. ""I was really proud of our guys, I thought we continued to get better,"" Horst said. ""We kind of fought through some adversity and to put ourselves in position to have a real chance to win in spite of all those things, I thought was pretty remarkable."" ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press The ""Death Lineup"" breathed new life into the Golden State Warriors. It was yet another reminder: In the NBA playoffs, where even a brief downward slide can be enough to end a season, even the best teams won't hesitate when they feel a need to shake up their starting lineups. Desperate times in the first round sent Cleveland to desperate lineup measures. Toronto, the team that finished with the NBA's second-best regular season record, sought a spark by changing its starting five against the Cavs for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Utah showed Houston a new look Sunday in Game 4 of their West semifinal matchup, and while the Jazz slowed the high-powered Rockets at times they still fell into a 3-1 series deficit. And then there's the Warriors, who were coming off a big loss in Game 3 against New Orleans so they put their five best players ‚Äî Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green ‚Äî on the floor Sunday to start a game for the first time all season. The result was a rout , one that allowed the Warriors to head home with a 3-1 lead in their series against the Pelicans. ""Anytime we've been in any danger over the years, we've sort of gone to this lineup,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. ""The lineup worked or whatever, but it's not about the lineup. It's really not."" All due respect to Kerr, he might be overstating that one. Golden State's starting five on Sunday ‚Äî some call it ""The Death Lineup"" because of how opponents tend to succumb against it, others prefer ""Hamptons Five"" because Curry, Thompson, Iguodala and Green were the players who went to the Hamptons two summers ago in an effort to lure Durant to the Warriors ‚Äî was absolutely dominant. NBA.com charted them as being on the floor together for 18 minutes, during which they outscored the Pelicans 52-26. Every other Warriors lineup used over the other 30 minutes played the Pelicans even, 66-66. ""We got momentum on our side really early,"" Curry said. ""Every single person on the floor in that lineup is a playmaker. And so we have multiple options and just look for the best shot on every possession."" It wasn't exactly an in-case-of-emergency-break-glass move by the Warriors. But these NBA playoffs have seen some of those as well. Cleveland, which has a chance to win its way back into the Eastern Conference finals for the fourth consecutive year on Monday night if it can finish off a sweep of Toronto, almost didn't even get to this round. Facing a win-or-else Game 7 in the first round, the Cavaliers put LeBron James, Kevin Love, J.R. Smith and Tristan Thompson ‚Äî the four holdovers from their 2016 NBA championship team ‚Äî out to start with Kyle Korver. It was their first time starting together this season. James survived cramps, scored 45, and the Cavaliers held off Indiana to advance. They haven't lost since. ""All five of us, we knew what we could get out of each other,"" James said afterward. ""We've been in situations before. We've played in big games before. That's a comfort."" Toronto could use some of that comfort. Since James entered the league, only one No. 1 seed has gotten swept in the conference playoffs ‚Äî Atlanta, in 2015, by James and the Cavaliers. Toronto shook up its lineup in Game 3 on Saturday night by trying Fred VanVleet instead of Serge Ibaka, but the Raptors fell into the dreaded 3-0 series deficit when James made a running bank shot at the buzzer for the win. Everything is on the table for the Raptors now. ""You realize how big it is in this moment to get a victory,"" Raptors star DeMar DeRozan said. Sometimes, even subtle changes pay off nicely. Boston inserted role player Semi Ojeleye into its starting lineup before Game 5 of the Celtics' first-round series against Milwaukee. Ojeleye's role: Find a way to slow down Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. Ojeleye was on the floor to help open the next three games, the first starts of his rookie season. He scored 10 points in those games, though none of that mattered much to the Celtics. His primary role was defense, since Antetokounmpo averaged 27.8 points on 62 percent shooting in the first four games of the series. With Ojeleye in the lineup, Antetokounmpo averaged 23 points on 50 percent shooting in the last three games ‚Äî and seemed particularly out of sorts in Game 5, the first one where the Celtics made the change. Boston won that night by five points, and wound up surviving the series in seven games. ""He did a great job,"" Antetokounmpo said, tipping his cap to Ojeleye. ""He played hard. He competed."" And that's the secret, Kerr said. It's not about the names, he insists. It's about how well they perform. It's become a bit of a running joke around the Warriors that Kerr won't reveal his starting lineups until he absolutely has to, no matter how many times he is asked. But this time, after the results on Sunday, Kerr isn't holding his cards to his chest. Game 5 is on Tuesday night. The ""Death Lineup"" starts. ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Warriors 118, Cavaliers 113 | Golden State leads series, 3-0 By Scott Cacciola CLEVELAND ‚Äî LeBron James had stuffed another playoff game full of his usual brilliance. He scored. He passed. He rebounded. He defended. After two lopsided losses to start the N.B.A. finals, the Cavaliers fell in line behind him as they spent much of Wednesday evening fending off the Golden State Warriors. It was basketball at its best. Both teams exchanged ferocious blows. Both teams responded. But in the final minute, James ‚Äî perhaps the most fearsome player on the planet ‚Äî found himself in an unusual position: helpless. He could only watch as Kevin Durant of the Warriors sank a 3-pointer over the top of him, one final jolt from which the Cavaliers could not recover. The Warriors kept their air of invincibility intact with a 118-113 victory that put them on the brink of their second championship in three seasons. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to relax,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over.‚Äù Durant‚Äôs 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds remaining was the go-ahead basket as the Warriors scored the game‚Äôs final 11 points. It was a stunning display of offensive pyrotechnics that dovetailed with the Cavaliers‚Äô late-game collapse, a disheartening result that almost felt unfair, unjust, undeserved. The crowd at Quicken Loans Arena shuffled to the exits in disbelief. ‚ÄúWe thought we were going to win,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúWe had an opportunity.‚Äù James collected 39 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists, and Kyrie Irving added 38 points ‚Äî and still, it was not enough. Not against the Warriors and their all-world assemblage of talent. Durant finished with 31 points. Klay Thompson scored 30 points for Golden State, and Stephen Curry had 26 points and 13 rebounds. As this best-of-seven series moves to Game 4, scheduled for Friday night in Cleveland, the only question left seems to be whether the Warriors can become the first team in N.B.A. history to finish the playoffs with a 16-0 record. They are one win away, of course. It would be the starkest symbol of their dominance this season. ‚ÄúHaving a close game down the stretch ‚Äî honestly, it‚Äôs been a while,‚Äù Curry said. The bad news for Cleveland: No team in the finals has ever rebounded from a 3-0 series deficit to win the championship. Twelve teams have tried, and 12 teams have failed. In addition, the Warriors have not lost a game since April 10. They would need to lose four in the next 11 days to miss out on another title. It seems ‚Äî what is the word? ‚Äî unlikely. The Warriors entered the game mindful of what had happened against the Cavaliers in Game 3 of the finals last season. After losing the first two games of the series, the Cavaliers came out and crushed the Warriors by 30 here ‚Äî a startling result that gave the Cavaliers new life. They went on to win the championship, their first, in seven games. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre better from our experiences,‚Äù Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said. ‚ÄúYou win a championship, then lose one in heartbreaking fashion ‚Äî you‚Äôve pretty much seen everything at that point.‚Äù On Wednesday, J. R. Smith gave the Cavaliers a 6-point lead when he sank a 3-pointer with just over three minutes remaining. Cleveland would not score again. Golden State gladly filled the void. Curry made a layup, and then Durant connected along the baseline. After Kyle Korver of the Cavaliers missed an open 3-pointer, Durant spotted up from the top of the arc ‚Äî swish ‚Äî for a 114-113 lead. Irving left a jump shot short, and Durant and Curry finished the game with four straight free throws. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt our smartest game that we played all year,‚Äù Kerr said, ‚Äúbut it was maybe our toughest.‚Äù Before the game, James talked about improving his own play, about inspiring his teammates and about focusing on the task at hand. At the same time, he appeared to mix resolve with a hint of resignation. In the first two games of the series, James averaged 28.5 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists ‚Äî and the Cavaliers got clobbered both times. ‚ÄúI leave everything that I have out on the floor every night,‚Äù James said, ‚Äúso I‚Äôm always satisfied with the way I play.‚Äù As the Cavaliers took the court for warm-ups, the sweet beat of Journey‚Äôs classic rock ballad ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Believin‚Äô‚Äù filled the arena. These were desperate times. The home crowd, which was decked out in matching black T-shirts, watched the first quarter play out at a furious pace. Sure enough, the Cavaliers ‚Äî and James, in particular ‚Äî gave the fans reason to believe. He scored 16 points on 7-of-8 shooting before he took a seat with 1 minute 49 seconds left in the first quarter. ‚ÄúI gave everything that I had,‚Äù James said. What happened next reinforced the point that the Cavaliers cannot survive with James on the bench, not even for a few measly seconds. Curry drained consecutive 3-pointers as the Warriors closed the quarter on a 10-0 run. The building fell silent. Thompson, who had struggled with his shooting for much of the playoffs, helped ignite the Warriors, scoring 16 points in the first quarter. At one point early in the second quarter, James was 9 of 10 from the field ‚Äî and the Warriors led by 3. That was a bad sign for Cleveland. But James kept plugging. After Durant inadvertently hit him in the throat, James gathered himself and drove for a reverse layup. He was in the midst of another tour de force. Leaving nothing to chance, Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue left him on the court for the entire second quarter. The Warriors took a 67-61 lead into the third quarter before the Cavaliers threw everything they could at them. Irving dashed through the lane for a layup. Kevin Love made a 3-pointer. Smith emerged from obscurity to sink one of his own. It was a momentous stretch of team basketball for the Cavaliers, who had been leaning so heavily on James. For most of the second half, it looked like enough ‚Äî enough, at least, to steal one game and make the series competitive. Against any other team, that probably would have been the case. But not against the Warriors. Not this season. Not with history on the horizon.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Daniel E. Slotnik Jack McCloskey, whose canny decisions and steady leadership as general manager of the Detroit Pistons paved the way for their first two National Basketball Association championships, in 1989 and ‚Äô90, died on Thursday in Savannah, Ga. He was 91. His death, at a hospice care facility near his home in Savannah, was caused by complications of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, his wife, Leslie, said. When Mr. McCloskey joined the Pistons in December 1979, the team was on its way to the worst record in the N.B.A., at 16-66. The franchise was also on its 19th coach since it had joined the league as the Fort Wayne Pistons from Indiana in 1948. The Pistons had not played in the finals since 1956. Mr. McCloskey was hired to turn the team around, and the effort took years. He drafted the future Hall of Fame players Dennis Rodman, Joe Dumars and Isiah Thomas, who later became the head coach and the team president of the Knicks. Mr. McCloskey also engineered a string of trades, earning the nickname Trader Jack after acquiring the rugged center Bill Laimbeer, power forward Rick Mahorn, the 7-foot-1 center James Edwards and the dependable sixth man Vinnie Johnson. Fans were furious when he traded Adrian Dantley, a six-time All-Star forward, to the Dallas Mavericks for Mark Aguirre, a forward and a three-time All-Star ‚Äî until the Pistons won the championship the next season. After three losing seasons under Coach Scotty Robertson, Mr. McCloskey replaced him in 1983 with Chuck Daly, a future Hall of Famer. Under Mr. McCloskey and Daly, the Pistons became a sharp-elbowed team nicknamed the Bad Boys. They were known for an implacable defense that wore down dominant 1980s teams like Larry Bird‚Äôs Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson‚Äôs Los Angeles Lakers, as well as the ascendant Chicago Bulls led by Michael Jordan. Under Mr. McCloskey, Detroit made the playoffs nine times in a row, the Eastern Conference finals five consecutive seasons and the N.B.A. finals three straight years. In 1988, the Pistons made the finals for the first time in decades before losing to the Lakers, four games to three. But the next year, the Pistons had the best regular-season record in the N.B.A., at 63-19, then went 15-2 in the playoffs. This time they swept the Lakers (Johnson was injured during the series) to win the first championship in franchise history. Thomas, the small but dominant point guard whom Mr. McCloskey drafted in 1981, praised his general manager in the locker room after the game. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the man who deserves a lot of the credit for this championship,‚Äù Thomas told The New York Times as Mr. McCloskey was showered with Champagne. ‚ÄúHe slowly put us together. He picked the players and the coach and made all the moves.‚Äù The Pistons repeated as champions the next season, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in five games. But Detroit flagged after that the next two years in the playoffs, losing to the Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals and then to Patrick Ewing‚Äôs Knicks in the first round. Shortly after Tom Wilson was appointed president of the Pistons in 1992, Daly resigned and Mr. McCloskey moved to the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were in desperate need of better front-office management. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here a long time, perhaps too long,‚Äù Mr. McCloskey told The Associated Press that May. He worked with the Timberwolves until 1995, during which time they never had a winning record. John William McCloskey was born in Mahanoy City, Pa., a coal mining town, on Sept. 19, 1925. His mother, the former Beulah Spade, was a homemaker; his father, Eddie, was a miner. Mr. McCloskey lettered in baseball, football and basketball in high school, then played football at the University of Pittsburgh before serving in the Navy at Okinawa during World War II. After the war he finished his education at the University of Pennsylvania, where he continued to play three varsity sports. After graduating he played one game with the Philadelphia Warriors of the N.B.A. before becoming a high school basketball coach. Mr. McCloskey became the head basketball coach at Penn in the mid-1950s and stayed there until he took over Wake Forest‚Äôs program in 1966. In 1972 he became the head coach of the Trail Blazers, compiling a 48-116 record over the next two seasons before resigning in 1974. He was an assistant for the Lakers under Coach Jerry West before joining the Pistons. After leaving Minnesota, he was a consultant for the Toronto Raptors. His marriage of 28 years to Anita Morales ended in divorce. He married Leslie Gray in 1977. Besides his wife, he is survived by six children from his first marriage, his sons, Michael, Steve, Roman and John, and his daughters, Robin and Molly McCloskey; a stepson, Ryan Gray; a stepdaughter, Lisa Haugen; 14 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.

Sports,"Advertisement    Benjamin Hoffman     KEEPING SCORE JUNE 10, 2017  Even in those unusual moments when an opposing team has a big second-half lead on the Golden State Warriors, the prevailing sense is that the game is not over because of the Warriors‚Äô ability to go on extended offensive runs. But in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals Friday night, the Cleveland Cavaliers turned that notion on its head and had the game all but won in the first quarter. In an offensive display unlike anything the finals had quite seen before, Cleveland put up 49 points in the first 12 minutes, not only setting a finals record but scoring more points than they did in the second halves of Games 1 and 2. The best the Warriors could do after that initial onslaught was to knock the deficit down to 11 points in the fourth quarter, and it was back up to 21 by game‚Äôs end. In other words, the Warriors never got close. The Cavaliers‚Äô eventual total of 137 points was also the most by one team in a non-overtime finals game since 1987. Afterward, both teams credited Cleveland with throwing a haymaker to start the game and then holding off Golden State for the remaining three quarters, when the difference between the teams was only five points. Advertisement ‚ÄúIt was hard for them to keep up with us tonight,‚Äù the Cavaliers‚Äô Kyrie Irving said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time all series, but we just kept attacking.‚Äù Advertisement His backcourt mate, J. R. Smith, said the Cleveland locker room had been surprisingly mellow before the game, and Irving said the Cavaliers just had to remind themselves of their own capabilities rather than focus on how close the Warriors were to winning the championship. ‚ÄúWe understand who they have on their team and what they‚Äôre about and how established they are,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I think that in those three losses, we lost track of who we were at the time. We‚Äôre still a special team as well. We are here for a reason.‚Äù What made the Cavaliers‚Äô achievement on offense in Game 4 even more remarkable is that the Warriors, despite all their dazzling scorers, take great pride in their defense. Coming into Game 4, the Warriors had the N.B.A.‚Äôs most efficient defense in the playoffs in terms of points allowed per 100 possessions. But that did not matter against a Cavaliers club that ranked first in offensive efficiency.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

From the opening shot of the game ‚Äî a 24-foot 3-pointer by Smith off an assist from LeBron James ‚Äî the stingy Warriors defense was on its heels. Kevin Love led all players with 14 points in the quarter, and the Cavaliers simply outplayed the Warriors in every respect. The starkest change in that quarter was the aggressiveness of Tristan Thompson, the Cavaliers‚Äô center, who won the opening tip for the first time in the series. He then set a tone for the game with physical play under the basket, extending possessions with three offensive rebounds and making the most of his playing time, which had been reduced as he struggled in the first three games of the finals. Draymond Green, the Warriors‚Äô volatile power forward, was unwilling to accept the notion that his team had been outplayed in the quarter, saying the officials played a role in Cleveland‚Äôs hot start by calling 12 fouls on Golden State against just six on Cleveland. ‚ÄúThey were aggressive,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to give them some credit. But when everyone has two fouls, it‚Äôs hard to match the physicality.‚Äù Green was referring to the two fouls each in the first quarter that he, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry and Andre Iguodala received. But while the fouls may have reduced Golden State‚Äôs ability to play aggressively on defense, the 49-33 score at the end of the quarter could have been even worse if Cleveland had shot better than 14-of-22 from the free-throw line. ‚ÄúThe reason we didn‚Äôt hit 50 is because I can‚Äôt shoot a free throw,‚Äù James said afterward, taking a jab at himself. Advertisement Still, 49 was pretty impressive, an astounding number that propelled the Cavaliers to victory, gave them another entry in the N.B.A. record book and perhaps changed the tone of the series.

(Reuters) - Artreyo Boyd may not have a fierce crossover dribble or be able to soar through the air like NBA players but that has not kept him from becoming a top-drafted basketball professional like LeBron James without leaving the comforts of his couch. Boyd, a round-faced and dreadlocked 23-year-old from Cleveland, is the face of the NBA 2K League, which will pit the world's best players in the popular NBA 2K video game against each other when the inaugural season begins on Tuesday. The NBA is the first U.S. professional sports league to run an esports league and it has attracted gamers from all walks of life, among them a former financial advisor who played football in college and a former collegiate basketball player. For Boyd, better known by his player name 'Dimez', the NBA's push into esports offered a timely dose of clarity to his long-term plans since he had no day job and routinely spends more than 12 hours a day playing NBA 2K.

Boyd, whose avatar is a 6-foot-5 (1.99m) point guard that weighs 215 pounds (97.5 kg), was drafted first overall by the Dallas Mavericks' Mavs Gaming four weeks ago at New York's Madison Square Garden in an event that mirrored an NBA Draft.

Competitors, who are subject to a drug-testing policy, do not control actual NBA players but rather avatars of themselves they have created. Players will live for free in their team's region during the season and will be flown to a studio each week to compete where they vie for $1 million in prize money across three tournaments and playoffs, with $300,000 going to the NBA 2K League champion. The NBA has already referred to the 2K League as the fourth league in its family alongside the NBA, WNBA and G League and called the competitors ""athletes"" given the mix of physical and mental skills needed to excel.

""But it's kind of funny how it all worked out. I always wanted to be in the NBA but I never saw myself getting into the NBA the way I am in it now."" Alexander¬†Bernstein, 24, took a more non-traditional route to the 2K League as he played college football in South Dakota where he earned a sociology major before taking a job in Beverly Hills as a financial advisor. ""I was great at the job but it wasn't something that I 100 percent had my heart into,"" said Bernstein, who was drafted in the fourth round by Philadelphia's 76ers GC. ""And at the end of the day playing video games was something that I was very attracted to and it brought me joy."" Bernstein, who goes by the gamer tag 'Steez', is now eager to join his peers and help dismantle some of the commonly-held stereotypes about the world of esports. ""It's not really the cliche of sitting around and eating a bag of potato chips and playing games,"" said Bernstein. ""There is more to it and this is starting to explode and be a new world order that's taking over regular sports.""

Technology,"Advertisement By NELLIE BOWLESDEC. 28, 2017  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Joe Buttram, a former mixed martial arts fighter and start-up security guard turned cryptocurrency investor, was looking at a new toy called a CryptoKitty. ‚ÄúYou can see he wants to sire,‚Äù Mr. Buttram, 27, said. For about 20 of the cryptocurrency called ether ($14,000 at the time), the cartoon cat would ‚Äúmate‚Äù with one of Mr. Buttram‚Äôs, and he would get a new CryptoKitty. That kitty could inherit its father‚Äôs desirable eyes (traits include thicccbrowz) or fur pattern (like totesbasic). Let‚Äôs back up. Every new technology gets a game that helps bring it careening into the mainstream. Social networks had FarmVille. Mobile phones had Angry Birds. And, its investors hope, blockchain has CryptoKitties. Blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Ethereum, ledgers for recording virtual currency transactions, is booming, and CryptoKitties is the first big blockchain game. As they did with baseball cards, people collect CryptoKitties, but these cards can breed. Advertisement The Ethereum network, whose currency is called ether, is valued at about $70 billion, but not many of the investors really know what their ether can be used to do. And now here‚Äôs one thing you can do with it: Ether is the only currency that exists in the CryptoKitties world. Advertisement Since CryptoKitties was introduced a month ago, 180,000 people have signed up. They‚Äôve spent about $20 million in ether, and more than 10 kitties have sold for over $100,000. Based in Vancouver, British Columbia, CryptoKitties is now a team of 18. Next the company is starting social games like kitty beauty contests and expanding into other ‚Äúblockchain collectibles.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just like, man, people want cats,‚Äù said the CryptoKitties co-founder Mack Flavelle, who works for AxiomZen product design studio. ‚ÄúWe thought it would build slowly, take a few months, but it‚Äôs been so fast.‚Äù              WikiLeaks is gifting two #CryptoKitties to President Trump and Secretary Clinton.

But high transaction fees, slow processing and wildly fluctuating prices make it a tricky replacement for cash. So what to do with $73 billion of digital money? ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to do with it, so hey, for a couple bucks now you can get a cat,‚Äù Mr. Flavelle said. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs even pretending it‚Äôs going to be a transactional currency anymore. It‚Äôs a stored value.‚Äù Industry experts echo Mr. Flavelle‚Äôs conception of cryptocurrency as, well, not yet a currency and digital kittens as a pretty good use for it. Advertisement One of those is Dan Romero, 30, the general manager of Coinbase, the main trading platform for cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúIn 2014, it was more corporate, everyone was just talking about using cryptocurrency for payments,‚Äù Mr. Romero said. No longer: ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre all talking about CryptoKitties,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a resurgence of playing, and that‚Äôs a good sign.‚Äù Like Beanie Babies before them, CryptoKitties are collectibles. Each kitty has a core ‚ÄúDNA‚Äù on the blockchain, and the game is basically to mate them (the illustrators do not go deep into specifics) and see what kitty results. The progeny tend to have their parents‚Äô traits (an expensive cat will have an expensive kitten) but might surprise or disappoint with more or less valuable traits than either of its parents. There‚Äôs a limited number of highly desirably first-generation kitties and four billion possible combinations of cats based on traits the on-staff artists have created (whisker aesthetic, background color, fur type). The company gets a 3.75 percent cut of the breeding and selling auctions. ‚ÄúAnd the other thing we have are fancy cats, which are hard to unlock, and if you get one of those, it‚Äôs fancy,‚Äù Mr. Flavelle said.

The activity helps make sense of the strange world of Ethereum, Mr. Flavelle said. ""In our lizard brains we have fear of chaos,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCollecting allows you to bring order.‚Äù And the game does seem to be attracting a lot of people who are now willing to go through the byzantine process of getting a digital wallet and acquiring ether. When the company started, there were so many cat-based transactions, it slowed down the Ethereum network, upsetting regular traders.

By Claire Cain Miller FEB. 14, 2018 Susan Fowler had tried going to human resources. She had tried going to her managers. She had tried transferring departments. But nothing changed. The sexual and sexist comments she received as an engineer at Uber kept coming. So she went online and wrote a 3,000-word blog post exposing the behavior. The internet was born in text.

We‚Äôre taking stock of the internet right now, with writers who cover the digital world cataloging some of the most consequential currents shaping it. If you probe those currents and look ahead to the coming year online, one truth becomes clear. The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text, and the exploding reach and power of audio and video.

By Nellie Bowles FEB. 14, 2018 Political memes have gone mainstream as the distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan has closed. President Trump has frequently retweeted his fans‚Äô meme work, #MeToo jumped from social media to every workplace, and political campaigns started to invest in the form more seriously. The political meme ‚Äî text over an image, sometimes short videos or digital clip art meant to spread and be imitated ‚Äî is often a guttural, simple message couched in humor, like the doctored video from September of Hillary Clinton being hit with his golf ball.

But these days, major brands have been forced to rethink how they advertise online. Companies from Kellogg to AT&T have come under fire for inadvertently funding bigotry, hate speech and misinformation, often because they were using automated ad technology to reach groups of people across a vast number of sites and videos.

By Amanda Hess FEB. 14, 2018 For all the talk about the internet‚Äôs power to democratize the media, Instagram can present an awfully traditional picture of what a woman is supposed to be.

(Hey, @kyliejenner.) But perfectly polished Instagram feeds have now given way to real ones, in which women in particular are showing what they actually look like. And because they have demanded to be seen, brands have taken notice, too. Advertisement "
Politics,"Advertisement By NEIL MacFARQUHARJULY 8, 2017  MOSCOW ‚Äî There was a certain degree of exulting in the Russian capital on Saturday in the wake of the first meeting between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Trump, with Mr. Putin himself saying that the American president seemed satisfied with his answers on the hacking issue and that the talks had set the stage for improved relations. Asked repeatedly about the two presidents‚Äô conversation about accusations of Russian hacking during the 2016 American election, Mr. Putin said at a news conference in Hamburg, Germany, that Mr. Trump had paid a lot of attention to the issue, asking multiple questions. ‚ÄúWhen possible, I answered his questions in detail,‚Äù Mr. Putin said, noting that he had reviewed previous exchanges that he had had with former President Barack Obama on the topic. ‚ÄúI got the impression that my answers satisfied him.‚Äù And asked repeatedly whether Mr. Trump believed his denials about Russian interference, Mr. Putin said each time that a reporter should ask the American president. Advertisement One Russian tabloid called the meeting ‚Äúhistoric,‚Äù and over all there was a sense of relief that if short on concrete agreements, the talks seemed to halt the downward spiral in relations and lack of contact between the two countries. Advertisement This meeting ‚Äúopened the way to a second, a third, a fourth meeting, where meaningful decisions will be made,‚Äù Sergei Markov, a political commentator close to the Kremlin, wrote on Facebook. He hailed the return to ‚Äúnormal contacts,‚Äù which he said had been destroyed by Mr. Obama, who sought to isolate Russia after it seized Crimea in March 2014. Amid the cheering in Moscow, however, there were notes of caution about the frequent gaps between what Mr. Trump says and what he does and can deliver. And more important, there was a recognition that the domestic mood toward Russia in the United States remained sour. The main message that emerged after more than two hours of talks on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg on Friday was that deals were possible, analysts said, and the mere fact that the two presidents had met in person for the first time since Mr. Trump was elected mattered more than the lack of a breakthrough. ‚ÄúIt is important that they finally met because if you look at the history of the relations between Washington and Moscow, these relations always depended to a large extent on the personal contact between the two leaders,‚Äù said Andrei V. Kortunov, the director of the Russian International Affairs Council, a foreign policy research group, in an interview. ‚ÄúThey defended their trenches, but tried to keep options for future compromises open.‚Äù The two accounts of the meeting ‚Äî one from Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and the other by the American secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the only two officials in the room besides the two presidents ‚Äî differed in some important details. For more than 70 years, U.S. presidents have spoken as one voice on how a free and united Europe is in America‚Äôs national security interests. Notably, Mr. Tillerson said that Mr. Trump had confronted Mr. Putin about Russian interference in the 2016 election during a ‚Äúrobust and lengthy‚Äù discussion. In Mr. Lavrov‚Äôs account, Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin‚Äôs denial. ‚ÄúBelieve Lavrov,‚Äù Mr. Putin‚Äôs spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters on Saturday when asked about the divergent accounts. Some Russian officials expressed particular delight at that version. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe neocons are furious,‚Äù Alexei K. Pushkov, a former chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian Parliament, wrote on Twitter, referring to neoconservatives in the United States. ‚ÄúTrump accepted Putin‚Äôs words about Russia‚Äôs noninterference in the American election. He does not want to stand at the ‚Äòanti-Russian hysteria‚Äô bus stop.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIt was important for Trump to hear Putin: After all, back in Washington, he is fed informational gruel that is mixed up in the fake.‚Äù Mr. Putin seemed to try to break the ice with Mr. Trump by referring to his travails with the news media back home. Mr. Putin gestured toward members of the press who had been allowed to photograph them before the meeting started and said, ‚ÄúThese are the ones that insulted you?‚Äù according to a Twitter message from a member of the Kremlin press pool. Mr. Trump could be heard agreeing, saying, ‚ÄúYou are right about that.‚Äù              ""–í–æ—Ç —ç—Ç–∏ —Ç–µ–±—è –æ–±–∏–∂–∞–ª–∏?"": –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –∏ –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø –æ–±—Å—É–¥–∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–µ –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ pic.twitter.com/cWZQA8HjSC  During his news conference, Mr. Putin called the fact that the two sides were working together on the de-escalation zones in Syria ‚Äúa massive step forward.‚Äù He noted that work on delineating the zones and providing security had to be hammered out. ‚ÄúThis is painstaking, even tedious work, but it is extremely important,‚Äù he said. The Russian president also said he thought that the American position on Syria was becoming more ‚Äúpragmatic‚Äù with the realization that combined efforts might be better. That sentiment provoked some gloating in Moscow. ‚ÄúIt has become clear that Trump recognizes Russia‚Äôs serious intentions in Syria and wishes to join the settlement process and to be a party to the resolution of problems in Syria alongside Russia,‚Äù Adalbi Shkhagoshev, a member of the foreign affairs committee in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, was quoted as saying by the Russian news agency Tass.

Yet several Russian analysts also noted that the Trump administration had yet to settle on a Syria policy and that previous cease-fire agreements had not stuck. While there are points of agreement, the two countries also have significant differences, particularly America‚Äôs opposition to Iranian efforts to leverage the Syria conflict to gain broader influence in the Middle East. As long as the countries are talking, however, there is a sense that American and Russian military forces fighting with different forces on the ground there will not come to blows. ‚ÄúThe overall public reaction here is positive because people were concerned how this confrontation might end,‚Äù Mr. Kortunov said. Broadly, Russians recognized that this was just a first step, and that senior Trump administration officials like the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, often take a harder line on Syria or Ukraine. After his meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the Group of 20 summit on Friday, President Trump sent mixed messages about Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader and no stranger to difficult summit meetings, hailed the two presidents‚Äô meeting while noting that Mr. Trump was ‚Äúunpredictable.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúThat the president of the United States, for his part, spoke positively of the results of the meeting is very good,‚Äù Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as saying by Interfax, an independent news agency. ‚ÄúNow, the most important thing is for concrete steps realizing these agreements to follow.‚Äù Given the level of rancor in the United States toward Russia at the moment, there was some recognition that would be difficult. ‚ÄúWe still don‚Äôt know how able President Trump is in terms of delivering on anything specific in these agreements because Russia is still toxic in Washington,‚Äù Mr. Kortunov said. ‚ÄúAnything he agrees will be looked at with suspicion in Washington.‚Äù He and others noted that the open hostility toward the United States, particularly on Russian state television and in the government bureaucracy, might diminish now that Mr. Putin seemed to regard relations as moving in a better direction. There was no immediate report on some issues stressed by Moscow before the meeting, including the return of two Russian diplomatic compounds that the United States seized in December. Mr. Putin also wanted to use the meeting to further his goal of restoring Russia to its position of global influence and to project his own power, particularly important for a home audience that will vote in a presidential election in 2018. ‚ÄúI really hope so,‚Äù he said when asked whether his meeting with Mr. Trump would lead to improved ties between Moscow and Washington, adding ‚Äúit seems to me that the special preconditions for this have been created.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs for relations on a personal level, I believe we have established them,‚Äù Mr. Putin said. ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs TV persona differs sharply from the real man. He is a very straightforward person, grasps precisely what his interlocutor says, quickly analyzes and responds to questions or new elements of the discussion.‚Äù Mr. Putin twice ignored questions about Mr. Trump‚Äôs speech in Warsaw in which he urged Russia to cease ‚Äúits destabilizing activities in Ukraine and elsewhere.‚Äù Mr. Putin also said that he was not worried about competition with the United States over gas sales to Poland as long as they were not politicized. Audiences in both countries were also closely watching the power dynamics between the two men. While a body language specialist employed by the BBC suggested that Mr. Trump won the day, a Russian expert consulted by the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid was having none of it. Advertisement Mr. Putin exuded confidence, the Russian expert said, while Mr. Trump seemed to show a lack of it by sitting on the edge of his chair.

Politics,"Advertisement By LINDA QIUMARCH 16, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump has long avoided blaming ‚Äî or even naming ‚Äî Russia for meddling in the 2016 election that put him in office. But his administration has been far tougher on Moscow for cyberattacks that officials this week said not only sought to sway political opinions, but also wormed into power plants, aviation systems and other critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe. On Thursday, Mr. Trump was studiously silent as his administration imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign and what officials called other ‚Äúmalicious cyberattacks.‚Äù (The president did agree with a British assessment that Moscow was responsible for a nerve-gas attack in England against a former Russian spy and his daughter.) The Treasury Department said the sanctions were to punish ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs continuing destabilizing activities.‚Äù And for the first time, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. directly accused Russia of committing cyberattacks against ‚Äúenergy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors.‚Äù Advertisement Last week, by contrast, Mr. Trump said that ‚Äúthe Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúBut, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals,‚Äù the president said at a March 6 news conference. This pattern of diversion has steadily increased since Mr. Trump took office. Here is a look back at how the president and his own administration have parted ways on Russia. February 2018: Deflecting accusations of Russian meddling United States intelligence officials warned in mid-February that Russia had already begun meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. But Mr. Trump continued to suggest other countries could also be the culprit. ‚ÄúBy the way, I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling, or whatever you want to call it, with Russians and others possibly,‚Äù he said in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News. December 2017: Conflicting signals on national security  Mr. Trump‚Äôs first national security strategy blueprint made repeated references to Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election and its ‚Äúinformation operations as part of its offensive cyberefforts to influence public opinion across the globe.‚Äù Yet in his speech announcing the strategy on Dec. 18, Mr. Trump made one fleeting mention of Russia: of how it and China ‚Äúseek to challenge American influence, values and wealth.‚Äù He made no mention of Russian meddling and instead praised intelligence sharing between Russia and the United States in the face of terrorism threats. August 2017: Signing a sanctions bill reluctantly After Congress passed legislation in late July to impose sanctions on Russia and limit the president‚Äôs authority to lift them, Mr. Trump signed the bill but criticized it as ‚Äúseriously flawed ‚Äî particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch‚Äôs authority to negotiate.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Trump signed the legislation on Aug. 2. Several days earlier, President Vladimir V. Putin‚Äôs government had retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic compounds in Russia and telling the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff across the country. Mr. Trump did not respond, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment. However, the State Department described Moscow‚Äôs move as ‚Äúa regrettable and uncalled-for act.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,‚Äù the department said in a statement. July 2017: Suggesting he found Mr. Putin‚Äôs denial persuasive After Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin during a Group of 20 summit meeting, he recounted the Russian leader‚Äôs assurances that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election. ‚ÄúFirst question ‚Äî first 20, 25 minutes ‚Äî I said, ‚ÄòDid you do it?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòNo, I did not, absolutely not.‚Äô I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, ‚ÄòAbsolutely not,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that was published on July 12. ‚ÄúSomebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn‚Äôt have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.‚Äù What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

January 2017: Playing down Russian cyberattacks On Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report of its conclusions about a Russian cyberattack on the election. In a statement about his briefing on the cyberattacks that day, Mr. Trump pointed to ‚ÄúRussia, China, other countries.‚Äù Days before his inauguration, at a Jan. 11 news conference where he was asked whether he believed Mr. Putin ordered the hacking of American political committees, Mr. Trump said that ‚Äúas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.‚Äù He then added, ‚ÄúBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs dismissiveness of accusations of Russian interference predates his time in the White House. Late December 2016: Praising Putin in the wake of sanctions On Dec. 29, President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operators from the United States as punishment for Moscow‚Äôs attempts to influence the election. But in a move widely believed to be aimed at fostering good relations with the incoming Trump administration, Mr. Putin announced on Dec. 30 that he would not retaliate. Advertisement Mr. Trump promptly praised Mr. Putin‚Äôs decision.              Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!         A day later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn‚Äôt convinced that Russia had interfered in the election, telling reporters: ‚ÄúAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.‚Äù Early December 2016: Disparaging intelligence agencies after reports on Russian interference After reports in December by the The New York Times and The Washington Post that United States intelligence assessments had concluded that Russian election meddling sought to aid Mr. Trump, the president-elect disagreed.              Unless you catch ""hackers"" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?         In an unsigned statement responding to the news, the Trump transition team dismissed the assessment by comparing it to flawed intelligence reports in the lead-up to the Iraq war. ‚ÄúThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,‚Äù the statement said. October 2016: Questioning intelligence consensus that Russia is to blame On Oct. 7, the United States intelligence community released a joint public statement saying it was ‚Äúconfident that the Russian government‚Äù had directed cyberattacks on American individuals and institutions, including political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee. Three days after that, during the second presidential debate, Mr. Trump again cast doubt that Russia was responsible ‚Äî or even that there was a cyberattack in the first place. ‚ÄúMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they‚Äôre trying to tarnish me with Russia,‚Äù he said. September 2016: Continuing to cast doubt on Russian meddling As the official nominees of their parties, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving intelligence reports in early August. On Sept. 22, top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a statement saying that they had ‚Äúconcluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,‚Äù based on briefings they had received. Advertisement Four days later, during the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the D.N.C.‚Äù He continued: ‚ÄúI mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?‚Äù June 2016: Rejecting the D.N.C. claim that Russian hackers penetrated its files The Democratic National Committee and a cybersecurity firm said that Russian hackers had obtained a trove of internal campaign emails and political opposition research. In response, Mr. Trump suggested that the D.N.C. fabricated the story or hacked itself: ‚ÄúWe believe it was the D.N.C. that did the ‚Äòhacking‚Äô as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader,‚Äù he said in a campaign statement on June 15.

Business,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMAY 7, 2018, 7:37 A.M. E.D.T.  BOGOR, Indonesia ‚Äî  Indonesian President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo hosted China's premier on Monday and the two oversaw the signing of several memorandums aimed at boosting trade between the nations. After meeting with Premier Li Keqiang at the ornate presidential palace in Bogor, Jokowi said two countries of their sizes should be able to provide benefits for peace, stability and the welfare of the world. China is the world's most populous country and Indonesia is the fourth most populous. Jokowi said they discussed efforts to improve economic cooperation and that China agreed to import an additional 500,000 tons of Indonesian palm oil.

Business,"Advertisement By BEN CASSELMAN and JIM TANKERSLEYAPRIL 17, 2018  President Trump‚Äôs trade policies enjoy the strong backing of his supporters but are less popular among independents, moderate Republicans and others whose votes could decide control of Congress in the midterm election this fall. That could complicate Republicans‚Äô plans to make their economic record a central argument in their case for re-election. Over all, Americans are about evenly split on the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump announced early last month, according to a survey conducted in early April for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Support split mostly along predictable partisan lines, with 78 percent of Republicans supporting Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs and 74 percent of Democrats opposing them. Only 68 percent of self-described moderate Republicans said they supported the tariffs, however, and only 42 percent of independents did so. Support for the measure was also softer among better-educated and wealthier Americans of both political parties, echoing other evidence that backing for Mr. Trump‚Äôs agenda is weaker in the affluent suburbs that were once a Republican stronghold.              President Trump‚Äôs tariffs are popular among Republicans, but could cause him political problems among independents and more educated voters. Americans are evenly split on the tariffs over all, but they are more supportive of free trade in general.

But he opposes Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs, saying they will benefit a few favored industries while hurting the economy over all. Advertisement ‚ÄúA few people benefit from the protection,‚Äù Mr. Campbell said. ‚ÄúBut when prices rise as a result, the net effect, I think, is harmful to the economy.‚Äù Advertisement Minnesota is a key political battleground this year, with several competitive House seats and two Senate elections because of the resignation of Al Franken after a sexual-misconduct scandal last year. Mr. Campbell said that he was still likely to support Republican candidates, but that he was frustrated by the party‚Äôs shift toward protectionism and support for increased government spending. ‚ÄúI blame Republicans for that,‚Äù Mr. Campbell said. ‚ÄúA very significant portion of Republicans in Congress are not really conservative when it comes to spending.‚Äù The re-emergence of trade as a central political issue has scrambled traditional partisan alignments in ways that carry risks for both parties. Mr. Trump won the presidency partly by tapping into voters‚Äô concerns about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages, particularly in the industrial Midwest. But free trade still receives strong support among business groups, which have historically backed Republican candidates, and among big-dollar conservative political donors such as the Koch network. As recently as 2015, three-quarters of House Republicans voted for a measure meant to open trade even further ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúfast track‚Äù negotiating authority for President Barack Obama. Reflecting those tensions, congressional Republican leaders have criticized Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs as potentially harmful to businesses and consumers while also praising the president‚Äôs broader goals on trade. Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, opened a hearing on the effects of tariffs on the economy last week by saying the measures ‚Äúcurtail economic growth, discourage new investment, delay new hiring, and put American workers at a huge disadvantage to foreign competitors.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he added, ‚ÄúI remain committed to working with President Trump and the White House on strong, enforceable trade policies that will target bad actors and encourage economic growth here at home.‚Äù Democrats face their own challenges on the issue. As Republicans have shifted away from supporting free-trade agreements, Democrats have embraced them: In the Times poll, 73 percent of Democrats said they thought free-trade agreements helped the United States, compared with 51 percent of Republicans. But union members, long a key source of mobilization and support for Democrats, retain the party‚Äôs longtime skepticism of free trade. Advertisement ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an ideal issue for either party,‚Äù said Robert J. Blendon, who directs the Harvard Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health. ‚ÄúIt makes the issue slightly more complex because their voters‚Äô views don‚Äôt correspond to their interest groups.‚Äù For Republicans, Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade battles pose an additional risk of undermining the party‚Äôs core economic message. Republicans have tried to emphasize the tax law they passed in December, which cut taxes on businesses and most households. But trade has largely pushed the tax law from the headlines, and support for the law, which rose early in the year, now seems to be ebbing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre starting to certainly complicate the message,‚Äù said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey. The trade fight has also roiled financial markets, which had risen steadily during Mr. Trump‚Äôs first year in office. If that volatility continues, it could erode consumers‚Äô confidence in the economic recovery. There are hints that could already be happening: The University of Michigan‚Äôs measure of consumer sentiment dipped slightly in April, with many respondents citing trade as a source of concern. SurveyMonkey‚Äôs consumer confidence index also ticked down in April, with the largest declines coming among higher-earning households, which are much more likely to own stocks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible the war of words over trade, tariffs and sanctions, and the financial market turmoil we had has led to some setback in consumer confidence,‚Äù said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.              SurveyMonkey‚Äôs consumer confidence index, which combines five questions on Americans‚Äô financial and economic outlook, ticked down in April after holding steady earlier in the year.         APRIL 17, 2018  Consumer confidence remains high over all, however, and there is little evidence that the tariffs have hurt the economy so far. Retail sales rose in March, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Monday, and the job market continues to make steady progress. Economists say an outright trade war could derail the economy, but the tariffs announced so far fall well short of that. Ethan Brackenbury, a cost estimator for the federal Department of Energy in southeastern Washington State, said that he didn‚Äôt like the idea of a trade war, and that he hadn‚Äôt noticed any gain from the tax cut in his paycheck. But the economy seems strong in his area, he said, and he views any declines in the stock market as an opportunity to buy, not a signal to sell. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certainly not worried, nor am I excited,‚Äù Mr. Brackenbury said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see long lines of unemployment or those kinds of things. Everyone seems to be gainfully employed.‚Äù Follow Ben Casselman on Twitter: @bencasselman.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Renato Mariotti Mr. Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor. On Monday, The Times gave us the first glimpse of 49 questions the special counsel Robert Mueller could ask President Trump, as told to Mr. Trump‚Äôs legal team during negotiations for an interview. The questions reveal the topics Mr. Mueller believes could lead to potential liability for the president and help explain why Trump‚Äôs team has urged him not to agree to an interview. Last night, we learned that the specific questions were actually created by a Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, his interpretation of 16 specific subjects presented by Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team. Mr. Sekulow broke down the subjects and subtopics into the separate questions. This explains why Mr. Trump‚Äôs team had these questions ‚Äî it would be highly unusual for a prosecutor to give a witness questions in advance, but it is fairly common for a prosecutor to preview potential topics for a defense attorney before an interview. For that reason, I think it‚Äôs fair to assume that Mr. Sekulow‚Äôs questions track what Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team wants to cover in an interview. Mr. Trump‚Äôs team plans to use the questions to attack the special counsel as ‚Äúoverreaching‚Äù and going ‚Äúbeyond his mandate,‚Äù but the questions themselves suggest that Mr. Mueller has carefully stayed within his bounds. They contain nothing about obscure business deals or real estate transactions; the questions focus on coordination with Russia, obstruction of justice and topics that have been covered at length in the news media. None of the topics should have come as a surprise to Mr. Trump‚Äôs team, aside from an explosive question about efforts by the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to seek aid from the Kremlin, which is squarely about coordination with Russia. What should concern Mr. Trump‚Äôs team is how the questions zero in on Mr. Trump‚Äôs criminal liability. They leave little doubt that Mr. Trump is in serious jeopardy, particularly regarding obstruction of justice. I concluded months ago that Mr. Mueller would likely determine that the president obstructed justice, but the questions show that Mr. Mueller has already thought about how he would prove his case. The queries ask about Mr. Trump‚Äôs state of mind when he fired James Comey, when he erupted in anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and when he considered firing the special counsel. The questions are intended to prove the case against Mr. Trump through his own words. But it would be a mistake to count the number of questions focused on obstruction and conclude that Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation of the president focuses primarily on that topic. The inquiries on topics other than obstruction are broad. For example, the question ‚ÄúWhat discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with Mr. Putin?‚Äù encompasses a lot of ground. You could ask a similar broad question regarding the Comey firing ‚Äî ‚ÄùWhat discussions did you have about or with James Comey?‚Äù ‚Äî and cover much of the ground covered in the 18 questions related to him. The fact that the questions on topics other than obstruction are so broad does not necessarily suggest that Mr. Mueller has less evidence regarding those topics. A more likely possibility is that Mr. Mueller is not willing to tip his hand on those topics because the evidence he has regarding them hasn‚Äôt been extensively covered in the press. The president‚Äôs team could have gathered evidence of obstruction themselves, as I did, because Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweets and private conversations about Mr. Comey are well known. But it would be much harder for his team to know exactly what evidence Mr. Mueller has regarding the Trump Tower meeting, and Mr. Mueller wouldn‚Äôt want to disclose what he knows before the interview. Again, it‚Äôs worth remembering that Mr. Trump‚Äôs team, not Mr. Mueller, reportedly devised these questions. Mr. Mueller may have merely responded to specific inquiries from the Trump team, and they might have asked about fewer specific events related to other topics. If Mr. Trump does not agree to an interview, Mr. Mueller is reportedly considering subpoenaing him to testify before a grand jury. The president‚Äôs lawyers are considering whether to challenge Mr. Mueller‚Äôs authority to subpoena Mr. Trump for an investigation of potential crimes he committed while in office. No president has ever challenged a prosecutor‚Äôs right to subpoena him to testify in court. Although Bill Clinton received a grand jury subpoena for his testimony, it was withdrawn after he agreed to an interview. Mr. Trump‚Äôs claim would be novel, but the Supreme Court denied Richard Nixon‚Äôs challenge to a subpoena for documents and tapes as well as Mr. Clinton‚Äôs request to postpone a civil lawsuit during his presidency. The Supreme Court would likely rule against Mr. Trump, but he could use the challenge to delay Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation and his own testimony, which explains why Mr. Mueller is trying to negotiate a voluntary interview. What is hardest to know is why Mr. Mueller is seeking an interview of Mr. Trump at what appears to be an early stage of the investigation. Typically prosecutors wait until the end of an investigation to interview their most important witness, because they uncover additional evidence as the investigation progresses. So does this mean that Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation is wrapping up soon? Or does it mean that he is considering splitting his investigation into ‚Äúphases,‚Äù with a report at the end of each phase? I‚Äôm skeptical that he‚Äôll do that: What if he uncovers new evidence in Phase 2 that changes his view of something he investigated in Phase 1? The simplest explanation for the early interview is that Mr. Mueller thinks his chances of getting the president to agree to an interview will decrease over time. Mr. Trump could at some point decide to take the Fifth to avoid testimony, despite any political downside. The potential questions we saw this week explain why Mr. Trump is so concerned about his criminal liability. He faces difficult questions ‚Äî not just about obstruction but also about a host of topics related to coordination with Russia ‚Äî and his lawyers appear convinced that he cannot answer them without putting himself in further jeopardy.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Fact Check of the Day President Trump claimed ‚Äúall these investigators‚Äù are Democrats ‚Äî an overstatement ‚Äî and incorrectly said that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, served under President Obama for eight years.  By Linda Qiu President Trump said the facts This is exaggerated.  At least nine of the 17 lawyers on the team led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, have donated to Democratic campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission records. One has previously identified as a Democrat in a blog post.  Three others are registered as Democrats, The Washington Post and PolitiFact have reported. But the political affiliations of the remaining four lawyers are unclear.  A spokesman for the special counsel‚Äôs office confirmed the names of the lawyers who are on the team. Mr. Mueller is a registered Republican and Mr. Trump‚Äôs characterization of his work history is not entirely accurate.  A Republican president, George W. Bush, chose Mr. Mueller to lead the F.B.I. for a 10-year term that began in 2001. Mr. Mueller was asked to stay on by President Barack Obama in 2011. Two years later, Mr. Mueller retired from the F.B.I. after having served under Mr. Obama for around four and a half years.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Scott Reyburn LONDON ‚Äî There‚Äôs a new gold rush. But this precious metal doesn‚Äôt actually exist. The frenzy is for so-called cryptocurrencies ‚Äî or encrypted digital money ‚Äî and their value skyrocketed in 2017. The price of Bitcoin, the pioneer decentralized virtual currency, rose more than 1,300 percent last year, despite plunging 40 percent at one point in December. A Bitcoin rival, Ether, was up 8,000 percent. It is thought that the total worldwide value of cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion this year. Bitcoin and its derivatives have, for the moment, proved too volatile and unwieldy for day-to-day transactions. Yet the cryptocurrency model, underpinned by decentralized blockchain ledger technology, is increasingly becoming a force in more specialized areas of the economy. The art world is one of them. On Dec. 16, the nascent market for what might be called cryptoart appeared to reach a new level when the hitherto-unknown Distributed Gallery announced the auction of ‚ÄúReady Made Token,‚Äù a unique unit of a cryptocurrency that the gallery said was created by Richard Prince using technology from Ethereum, the network responsible for Ether. The online gallery describes itself as the first to specialize in ‚Äúblockchain-based artwork and exhibition.‚Äù It invited bids for the work, starting at one Ether, equivalent to about $650 at the time. (As of Friday, one Ether was worth about $1,200, according to ethereumprice.org.) The timed auction ends on Monday. The appearance of a crypto ‚Äúready-made‚Äù by an artist of Mr. Prince‚Äôs stature seemed to suddenly put blockchain on the art world map. Distributed Gallery even arranged for Mr. Prince to attend the inaugural Rare Digital Art Festival in New York on Saturday. But when buying into the world of cryptocurrencies, it can be difficult to determine what is real. Consider this Twitter post from Mr. Prince on Jan. 6: In fact, Distributed Gallery had no connection with the American artist. This virtual dealership and its ‚ÄúReady Made Token‚Äù are instead a playful experiment devised by Olivier Sarrouy, a philosophy and sociology lecturer at the University Rennes 2 in France, along with three friends. ‚ÄúWe were trying to explore how a cryptocurrency could relate to scarcity in the art market,‚Äù Mr. Sarrouy, 32, said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúIt reinterpreted Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs gesture of the ready-made in a radical way.‚Äù But why Richard Prince? ‚ÄúTo make a ready-made we needed a signature, but we were no one in the art world,‚Äù Mr. Sarrouy said, adding that he and his friends had chosen Richard Prince ‚Äúbecause he is the king of appropriation art.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur artwork has been created by our own Richard Prince,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd then there is the famous Richard Prince.‚Äù The appropriation of this name was certainly mischievous, given that the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Richard Prince continues to be involved in a lawsuit concerning his appropriation of an Instagram-sourced photograph for a 2014 exhibition. Adding further confusion, Mr. Prince‚Äôs most recent show of paintings at the Gladstone Gallery was titled ‚ÄúRipple,‚Äù which also happens to the name of a high-rising cryptocurrency. Mr. Prince declined to comment for this column. ‚ÄúThe project is interesting,‚Äù said Judy Mam, an organizer of the Rare Digital Art Festival, referring to the Distributed Gallery‚Äôs Duchampian token. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre talking about people who are putting up money,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the theoretical aspect of the project comes crashing down.‚Äù It no longer features in the festival program. As of Wednesday, Distributed Gallery‚Äôs auction had attracted four participants, who bid in Ether up to a value of about $2,600. Three bidders who thought they were competing for a work by the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù Mr. Prince have received or are in the process of receiving a refund, according to Mr. Sarrouy. ‚ÄúThe last one has bet knowing what this project was all about,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand is still the highest bidder.‚Äù Meanwhile, delegates at the Rare Digital Art Festival planned to discuss how to take memes and the other infinitely copyable stuff of the internet and turn them into ‚Äúrare, tradable blockchain assets.‚Äù Since late November, the most spectacular proof of this concept has been CryptoKitties. These cute virtual felines have a collectibility ‚Äî and tradeability ‚Äî that has attracted more than 235,000 registered users and more than 37,000 Ether, or about $52 million in transactions, according to the company. Cryptokitties.co charges 3.75 percent every time a cat ‚Äúbreeds‚Äù with another or is sold in its own marketplace. In December, one of the 100 ‚ÄúFounder Cats‚Äù traded for 253.3368 Ether, equivalent at the time to about $111,000. (It would now be more than $300,000.) Mack Flavelle, co-founder of CryptoKitties, which is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, thinks that digital art could be a major beneficiary of the explosion in virtual wealth. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not that much that people can do with cryptocurrency,‚Äù said Mr. Flavelle, 37, who planned to attend the festival on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe gave them something fun and useful to do with their Ethereum. It‚Äôs early days, but this could happen in the blossoming art space as well. The blockchain is an entirely new medium for art.‚Äù Matt Hall and John Watkinson, creators of CryptoPunks, also plan to be at the festival. CryptoPunks are 10,000 unique algorithm-generated characters, 9,000 of which were given away in June 2017 for collecting and trading on the Ethereum platform. Coveted ‚Äúpunks‚Äù are now selling for 10 Ether, or about $13,500 as of Wednesday, lifting the investment value of the founders‚Äô retained 10 percent. Being pegged to cryptocurrencies, digital collectibles have risen (and fallen) in value at a far faster rate than just about everything in the analogue art world. They can be bought for a few dollars and sold for nominal fees. There‚Äôs no need to enter the intimidating world of galleries and auction houses to acquire them. True, the buyer doesn‚Äôt get to own a physical work of art, but then consumer research increasingly reveals that millennials are less hung up about possession. ‚ÄúIf you can create a market for kittens, you can do it for digital art,‚Äù said Anders Petterson, author of the Hiscox Online Art Trade Report. ‚ÄúMillennials are comfortable with this kind of technology. There is the potential to open up an entire new ecosystem outside the traditional art world.‚Äù Plenty of people think cryptocurrencies will collapse under the weight of financial speculation. But if they don‚Äôt, they might just turn out to be the art world‚Äôs big game-changer.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMAY 4, 2018, 6:40 P.M. E.D.T.  ATLANTA ‚Äî  This is not a rant against cheerleading. That's a legitimate sport, played by elite athletes ‚Äî men and women ‚Äî who are worthy of admiration for their daring and skill. There might even come a day when cheerleaders are competing for gold, silver and bronze at the Olympics. None of which has anything to do with what happens on the sidelines of an NFL or NBA game. Those are scantily clad performers often leered at by fans ‚Äî or, as we're learning, perhaps even worse. The #MeToo era is the perfect time to retire these objectified, chauvinistic relics (and, while we're at it, ditto for the barely clothed women who climb into the ring to tell us what round it is at boxing and MMA events). Advertisement ""There is a misconception that cheerleading is just sideline dancing. This could not be further from the truth,"" said Savannah Parrot, an 11th-grade cheerleader at Niwot High School in Colorado. ""Cheerleaders are athletes. We compete in local, state, national and international competition and are evaluated on the difficulty of our routines including advanced tumbling passes and intricate stunt sequences. Advertisement ""If the NFL and NBA wanted to have cheerleaders,"" she went on to say, wise beyond her years, ""I have no doubt that qualified athletes would be honored to represent our sport."" That's not what the NFL and NBA want, of course. They're looking for attractive dancers showing lots of skin, apparently in the belief that sex is one of the best ways to keep fans entertained beyond the product on the field or court. And, according to a report by The New York Times , cheerleaders from Washington's NFL team were forced to play an even seedier role behind the scenes. During a 2013 trip to Costa Rica, they allege their passports were collected, they were asked to go topless for a calendar photo shoot that included male spectators, and they served as escorts for sponsors at a nightclub. The cheerleaders quoted in the report spoke on condition of anonymity because they signed confidentiality agreements. The team said it's concerned by the allegations and conducting an investigation, but we all know where this is going. Already, team president Bruce Allen said many current and former cheerleaders are contradicting allegations in the report. At least the NBA had the good sense to break from any pretense that these are cheerleaders, adorning their groups with names such as the Knicks City Dancers and Memphis Grizz Girls. These are dance groups, pure and simple, often performing sex-tinged routines that are a focal point of the between-game entertainment. In the NFL, the dancers play a less-prominent role (the stadiums, after all, are much larger) but they're still passed off as cheerleaders, for no apparent reason. They are certainly not there to lead cheers. Their main purpose seems to be wiggling around as provocatively as possible for the men in the crowd, all while ignoring how many women are now in the stands.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. This not-so-proud tradition can largely be traced to the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders becoming cultural icons in the 1970s, though it's worth noting that venerable franchises such as the Green Bay Packers, New York Giants and Pittsburgh Steelers don't have cheerleading squads. Advertisement It doesn't seem to have hurt their popularity or success on the field. ""It is way past time for the NFL and NBA to get rid of cheerleaders,"" said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of media studies at DePauw University in Indiana. ""Other pro sports such as hockey and baseball seem to manage without thinly clad women as part of the game-day experience."" These faux cheerleaders look increasingly archaic when so many women are stepping forward to say enough's enough. ""Given today's concerns about sexual harassment and domestic violence, the NFL and NBA clearly have tin ears in this matter,"" McCall said. ""Cheerleaders at pro games don't really cheer and inspire fans or players anyway. They are simply ornaments."" That should be offensive to all of us, but especially those who are actual cheerleaders. Tens of thousands of athletes participate in this rapidly growing sport at competitions around the United States, which prompted Disney to build a new 8,000-seat arena at its Wide World of Sports complex in Florida for those types of events. In 2016, the International Olympic Committee even recognized cheerleading as a provisional sport , the first step toward possibly claiming a spot at the Summer Games. Of course, cheerleading also serves as a complement to sports such as football and basketball. That's just fine, too. ""It is called cheerleading because their role is to lead the crowd in cheering for the team,"" said Shauna MacDonald, assistant director of the Gender & Women Studies Program at Villanova University. ""This, I think, can still be a positive and interesting purpose. Cheering is part of the ritual of sport, especially in North America, and having people to pep up the crowd and lead the cheers is a good thing. ""We know that this doesn't require cheerleading to look exactly as it does, because bands and pep squads also serve in these roles. In order for the culture of cheerleading to change, however, there would have to be some sweeping cultural shifts."" There's no sign of it happening in the NFL or NBA. Time's up for cheerleaders or dancers of whatever you want to call them. Advertisement ___ Paul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.

MILWAUKEE ‚Äî  San Antonio Spurs assistant Becky Hammon plans to interview for the Milwaukee Bucks' coaching job, a person familiar with the search told The Associated Press. The person requested anonymity because the team does not comment on potential candidates. A woman has never been a head coach in the NBA. Hammon is the first full-time female assistant in the league. ESPN.com first reported the planned interview. Hammon just finished her fourth season as an assistant with the Spurs. She served as coach of the Spurs' Las Vegas Summer League entry in 2015 and 2016. Hammon retired after the 2014 WNBA season following a 16-year playing career. The Bucks have said they have a thorough plan and process in place to hire their next coach, but with no timeline. Interim coach Joe Prunty is also expected to interview for the job after the former assistant led the team to a 21-16 record following Jason Kidd's firing in late January. Advertisement The job is attractive because of a new arena opening in the fall and budding NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo leading a young core. The Bucks took a small step forward this year after winning 44 games, two better than last year. They were eliminated in seven games in the first round of the playoffs by the Boston Celtics, a year after losing in six in the first round to Toronto.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by On Pro Basketball By Harvey Araton OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî Welcome to the 2017 N.B.A. finals, Round 3 of the league‚Äôs biggest perpetual mismatch in more than three decades. Statistically speaking, that is. For three straight years, the Cleveland Cavaliers have blown through three playoff rounds of the competitively malnourished Eastern Conference and arrived in the championship series with regular-season records that paled compared to those of the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors. The disparities in victories ‚Äî 14 two years ago, 16 last season and 16 again this season ‚Äî fall short of the largest in history: the 24-game advantages Milwaukee held over Baltimore in 1971 and Philadelphia had on the San Francisco Warriors in 1967. But not since the 1986 season (Boston over Houston) has there been an advantage as large as 16 games, and not since 1981, when Boston defeated a Houston team that had 22 fewer wins, has there been one greater. The Golden State-Cleveland difference over a three-year span is an extended, lopsided gap the likes of which the N.B.A. has never seen. And with one unprecedented statistical upset already in the books ‚Äî the Cavaliers‚Äô rallying from a three-games-to-one deficit in last year‚Äôs finals against a 73-victory Warriors club ‚Äî LeBron James and company entered Game 1 on Thursday night at Oracle Arena with an opportunity to build on their unusual achievement. Many would argue that part of what the Cavaliers proved last year was that regular-season N.B.A. results are virtually irrelevant ‚Äî particularly when star players rest on a handful of nights across the long and winding road to the playoffs. And regular-season injuries to a pivotal player can also distort a finals matchup, as when the title-winning Knicks had a 60-46 edge on the Lakers in 1970, after Wilt Chamberlain had played in only 12 regular-season games for Los Angeles before returning for the playoffs. The numbers otherwise indicate that the teams reaching the finals have usually been fairly close in regular-season achievement, especially over the last 40 years, when league expansion made it less likely to have one conference without a powerhouse club. But there have been other twists. When James carried the Cavaliers to the 2007 finals after winning 50 regular-season games, they were swept by the 58-win San Antonio Spurs, who benefited from the Warriors‚Äô first-round takedown of top-seeded Dallas, a 67-victory team that season. And when the Rockets, led by Moses Malone, carried a sub-.500 record (40-42) all the way to the finals in 1981 they faced that 22-game differential against the Celtics, who claimed the first of the three titles they went on to win with Larry Bird. Making a habit of postseason overachievement, the Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, found themselves in the same kind of anomalous predicament in the 1995 finals ‚Äî defending a title while meeting a team (Orlando) with a double-digit advantage in regular-season wins (57-47) ‚Äî that James and the Cavaliers appear to be in now. Houston, which was seeded No. 6 in the West and had reached the finals after beating Utah (62 wins), Phoenix (59) and San Antonio (62) proceeded to sweep Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal and the Magic. Until last season, that ‚Äô95 finals triumph by Houston ‚Äî in terms of the regular-season victory deficit overcome ‚Äî was second only to Golden State‚Äôs upset of Washington in 1975 after winning 12 fewer games. When Houston defended its title against Orlando, the Magic had never advanced that far in the postseason. The Cavaliers, conversely, are up against a team they barely beat in seven games a year ago, a feat that was helped along by the Game 5 suspension of Golden State‚Äôs Draymond Green. Some have disregarded Cleveland‚Äôs good, but hardly great, 51-31 record this season by noting that James not only rested on occasion but also coasted through the last 20 games or so before shifting into postseason gear. But the Warriors played 16 games this season without Kevin Durant, a player widely considered the next best to James. And in the end, Golden State recorded its third straight season of 65-plus victories. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been right at the top, best team in the league for three years straight now, super-impressive,‚Äù the Cavaliers‚Äô Kevin Love said during the buildup to the finals. But he added: ‚ÄúThe whole underdog thing is funny to me, because yeah, at the end of the day we are defending our title.‚Äù If they do it against these upgraded Warriors, it would be high time for less data and more declaration. Provided he performs as he did in the final three games last year, James would belong on basketball‚Äôs Mount Rushmore for puncturing the regular season as no one has before.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman There‚Äôs near-universal consensus among both economists and business leaders that Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs on steel and aluminum are a bad idea, and that the wider trade war those tariffs could trigger would be very destructive. But the chances of heading off this policy disaster are small, because this is a quintessential example of Trump being Trump. In fact, the tariffs are arguably the Trumpiest thing Trump has done so far. After all, trade (like racism) is an issue on which Trump has been utterly consistent over the years. He has spent decades railing at other countries that, he claims, hurt America by taking advantage of our relatively open markets. And if his views are based on zero understanding of the issues or even of basic facts, well, Trumpism is all about belligerent ignorance, across the board. But wait, there‚Äôs more. There‚Äôs a reason we have international trade agreements, and it‚Äôs not to protect us from unfair practices by other countries. The real goal, instead, is to protect us from ourselves: to limit the special-interest politics and outright corruption that used to reign in trade policy. Trumpocrats, however, don‚Äôt see corruption and rule by special interests as problems. You could say that the world trading system is, in large part, specifically designed to prevent people like Trump from having too much influence. Of course he wants to wreck it. Some background: Contrary to what some seem to believe, textbook economics doesn‚Äôt say that free trade is win-win for everyone. Instead, trade policy involves very real conflicts of interest. But these conflicts of interest are overwhelmingly between groups within each country, rather than between countries. For example, a trade war against the European Union would make America as a whole poorer, even if the E.U. didn‚Äôt retaliate (which it would). It would, however, benefit some industries that happen to face stiff European competition. And here‚Äôs the thing: The small groups that benefit from protectionism often have more political influence than the much larger groups that are hurt. That‚Äôs why Congress used to routinely pass destructive trade bills, culminating in the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930: Enough members of Congress were bought off, one way or another, to enact legislation that almost everyone knew was bad for the nation as a whole. In 1934, however, F.D.R. introduced a new approach to trade policy: reciprocal agreements with other countries, in which we exchanged reduced tariffs on their exports for reduced tariffs on ours. This approach introduced a new set of special interests, exporters, who could offer countervailing power against the influence of special interests seeking protection. F.D.R.‚Äôs reciprocal agreement approach led to a rapid unwinding of Smoot-Hawley, and after the war it evolved into a series of global trade deals, creating a world trading system that these days is overseen by the World Trade Organization. In effect, the U.S. remade world trade policy in its own image. And it worked: The global deals that evolved from the reciprocal tariff approach greatly reduced tariff rates around the world, while setting up rules that constrain countries from backtracking on their commitments. The overall effect of the evolution of the world trading system has been very salutary. Tariff policy, which used to be one of the dirtiest, most corrupt aspects of politics both in the U.S. and elsewhere, has become remarkably (though not perfectly) clean. And I‚Äôd add that global trade agreements are a striking and encouraging example of effective international cooperation. In that sense they make a real if hard to measure contribution to democratic governance and world peace. But then came Trump. Under U.S. trade law, which is written to be consonant with our international agreements, the president can impose tariffs under certain narrowly defined conditions. But the steel and aluminum tariffs, justified with an obviously bogus appeal to national security, clearly don‚Äôt pass the test. So Trump is in effect both violating U.S. law and throwing the world trading system under the bus. And if this escalates into a full-scale trade war, we‚Äôll be back to the bad old days. Tariff policy will once again be driven by influence-peddling and bribery, never mind the national interest. But that won‚Äôt bother Trump. After all, we now basically have an Environmental Protection Agency run on behalf of polluters, an Interior Department run by people who want to loot federal land, an Education Department run by the for-profit schools industry, and so on. Why should trade policy be different? It‚Äôs true that many big businesses and free-market ideologues, who thought they had Trump in their corner, are horrified by his moves on trade. But what did they expect? There was never any good reason to think that trade policy was safe from Trump‚Äôs depredations. P.S.: I‚Äôll be taking questions on Trump and trade over the next few days. Leave questions here or here, and I‚Äôll answer some of them next week. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Sports,"Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJUNE 1, 2017  In a postseason in which they have seen little to no competition, the Golden State Warriors kept right on rolling and tied the N.B.A. record for consecutive postseason wins at 13 with a 113-91 drubbing of the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 1 of the N.B.A finals. The Warriors‚Äô Big Four lineup only got significant offensive contributions from two of its members, but that was still far too much for LeBron James and the Cavaliers‚Äô other stars. Looking like they had something to prove, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry put on a show in Game 1, combining for 66 points, 18 assists and 14 rebounds. On defense the Warriors employed the strategy that worked so well in 2015, letting James operate as a one-man show. The game‚Äôs best player hardly disappointed with 28 points, 15 rebounds and 8 assists despite being guarded closely by Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala all game, but he did not get nearly enough help from any of his teammates outside of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and did plenty of damage to his own team‚Äôs chances by committing 8 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. ‚ñ† Much was made of Kevin Durant‚Äôs explosion in his return to the finals, but Stephen Curry was nearly as impressive, scoring 28 points to go with 8 assists and 6 rebounds. As he did all season, and throughout the playoffs, Curry led his team in plus/minus, with the Warriors outscoring the Cavaliers by 20 points in his 34 minutes of playing time. Durant was second on the Warriors with a plus-16 while every single member of the Cavaliers recorded a negative score in that category. Advertisement ‚ñ† The Warriors gave playing time to 13 players, but only Durant and Curry scored in double figures. While Draymond Green and Klay Thompson provided plenty of value on the defensive end, the team will likely need more than their 9 and 6 points going forward. Thompson was especially bad on offense, shooting just 3 of 16 from the field and missing all five of his 3-point attempts. When Thompson is playing well, opposing defenses get spread dangerously thin, but if Cleveland decides Thompson is truly not a threat they may be able to put more pressure on Curry and Durant. Advertisement ‚ñ† The Cavaliers got plenty of production from LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, but the Warriors‚Äô stifling defense completely eliminated the rest of the Cavaliers. Chief among the missing contributors was Kyle Korver, the sharpshooter that Cleveland acquired mid-season to create floor-space. At this stage of his career Korver is on the court almost entirely for his shooting, but he was a ghost in the game, chewing up 20 minutes while taking just three shots and missing all of them. If the Cavaliers cannot find open looks for Korver they need to replace him on the court with someone who contributes more in terms of defense or playmaking. ‚ñ† Rebounding has been a chief concern for the Warriors in each of their last two Finals appearances, with Tristan Thompson outclassing the smaller Golden State players repeatedly. The Cavaliers‚Äô starting center was a non-factor in Game 1, pulling down just 4 rebounds in 22 minutes and not scoring any points. The disappearing act resulted in Golden State keeping their rebounding disadvantage to a reasonable 59-50 despite Kevin Love pulling down 21 and James chipping in with 15. Thompson was especially missed in terms of offensive rebounding, where he is among the best in the game at extending possessions. For Cleveland‚Äôs offense, which shot 34.9 percent from the field in Game 1, to keep pace with the Warriors they will need Thompson to provide those second chances following missed shots. ‚ñ† Anyone taking too much from the result of this game should look into last year‚Äôs Games 1 and 2 in which Golden State won by 15 and 33 points. From that point forward the Cavaliers outscored the Warriors by 52 points while winning four of five games to steal the championship. Both teams have appeared rusty thus far, with missed layups on both ends of the court, some quick fouls on both sides, and several players appearing frustrated. For all of the scorers available for both teams, it was Zaza Pachulia who scored the most over the game‚Äôs first three minutes, with his four points matching Cleveland‚Äôs total. Golden State finally got its normal offense going with an alley-oop from Draymond Green to Kevin Durant, but Cleveland has kept pace and the score was 12-12 near the midpoint of the first quarter. The Warriors, trying to get things going on their home court, have already tried to shake things up by bringing Andre Iguodala in for Green, who picked up two fouls, including a particularly egregious one on the offensive end. As expected, Coach Steve Kerr was once again ruled out of being on the bench with the Warriors as a result of his lengthy recovery from a series of issues with his back. It is unclear if he will be able to return for any games in the finals. After a mid-range jumper from Stephen Curry got Golden State out of a little funk, the Warriors showed off some newfound offensive diversity with a pair of powerful dunks by Kevin Durant that helped erase a three-point lead that Cleveland had opened up. But Cleveland has not lowered their intensity at all, with their defenders punching at the ball going for steals and their offensive players aggressively trying to get to the basket. Advertisement The benches for both teams are starting to see some action, which will change the strategy some for both sides, with the Warriors bringing in JaVale McGee, their top rim protector other than Draymond Green, and the Cavaliers bringing in Deron Williams, their best playmaker off the bench. The first quarter closed with the Warriors leading the Cavaliers 35-30, with Andre Iguodala sinking a 3-pointer at the buzzer to open up his team‚Äôs largest lead of the game. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 10 points each (Durant also has 5 assists), but LeBron James was absolutely relentless on the other end, scoring 13 points and almost single-handedly keeping his team in the game, with nearly every Warriors shot for much of the quarter being answered with one of his own. The Warriors are shooting well after a rough start, but it is their success on offensive rebounds which has been the biggest key for them, as they have repeatedly been scoring on second chances. After so much talk about LeBron James resting this season, the juggernaut of a forward played all 12 minutes of the first quarter and was back out scoring the first two points of the second quarter as Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry took a seat on the bench to stay fresh. Golden State has typically struggled with both of their best scorers on the bench, but Draymond Green came back into the game and kept things moving, while Andre Iguodala went about disrupting James. On a possession that could portend bad things for James in terms of how the game is being called, Iguodala wrestled the ball out of his hands, with no foul call despite plenty of contact. James finally took a break shortly after, having played the game‚Äôs first 14 minutes. With James on the bench, and Golden State‚Äôs lead starting to build, the Cavaliers are still searching for a reliable offensive performer beyond James and Kyrie Irving. Kevin Love is third on the team with 5 points but has been mostly silent since a good start to the game. James came back with 7:26 left in the half with his team trailing, 41-34. After a brief visit to the bench, LeBron James got his team‚Äôs offense moving again and is now up to 17 points and 9 rebounds. Advertisement But the herculean efforts by James and Kyrie Irving (who had a nifty 4-point play and is up to 15 points) have not been enough to keep pace with the Warriors, who have opened up a 10-point lead with just over 3 minutes left in the second quarter. A big problem for Cleveland, beyond the rebounding issues they have had, has been turnovers. They have turned the ball over 8 times (including 3 by James) while Golden State has turned the ball over just once. Considering the Warriors‚Äô reputation for overly-flashy play that leads to losing the ball, the disparity is definitely notable.              .@KyrieIrving says count it from DEEP! #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/RyBdiOU9mv  In a first half that was not nearly as sharp as either team would have preferred, the Warriors went into the locker room leading the Cavaliers 60-52. Kevin Durant may be the new guy in town ‚Äî and he has certainly lived up to his advance billing with 23 points, 6 assists and 4 rebounds ‚Äî but the script for the first half of this game seemed ripped right out of last year‚Äôs finals with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving valiantly battling to keep pace with a far deeper Golden State lineup.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. James and Irving combined for 36 points in the half, but the rest of the Cavaliers combined for just 16. The Warriors appear to be comfortable letting James get to the basket, with Durant and Andre Iguodala making him work hard for his points while their teammates shut the rest of the Cleveland roster down entirely. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the game, though, has been the Warriors keeping things so close to the basket. The team that has the reputation for living and dying by the 3-pointer went just 3 for 13 from 3-point range, but was still able to succeed thanks to 11 offensive rebounds and a number of strong plays close to the basket from Durant, who already has set a career-high in a playoff game with six dunks. For Cleveland to make up the gap in the second half, they will need to reduce their turnovers, stop letting Golden State get second-chance baskets on offense, and will need to find some way to slow down Durant. The Warriors opened up the second half by forcing yet another Cleveland turnover and then having Kevin Durant knock down a 3-pointer on the other end of the court. Some sloppy mistakes on the offensive end by Cleveland, a shot tossed up by Zaza Pachulia that miraculously found the basket, and a mid-range jumper by Stephen Curry and suddenly Golden State‚Äôs lead has stretched to 15 points with just under 10 minutes left in the third quarter. The Cavaliers are up to 15 turnovers. Advertisement The Warriors built their lead to 21 points but Cleveland‚Äôs offense woke up enough to narrow it back to a 15-point gap despite Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry being up to a combined 46 points. Amid a solid lead for Golden State, there still has to be some concern about the play of Klay Thompson, who has shot just 2 for 12 from the field for 4 points. Thompson has been in a funk for most of the playoffs, and that has continued on the offensive end in Game 1, though he has remained a tenacious defender on the other end of the court. If anything, Thompson‚Äôs struggles illustrate why the Warriors wanted to add a player like Durant to the mix who is less prone to hot streaks and cold streaks. Many have blamed last year‚Äôs collapse on a cold streak by Curry, but a similar one by Thompson this year has barely slowed the Warriors down thanks to Durant. Golden State committed a few turnovers, and Cleveland kept pressing on offense, narrowing the gap all the way to 12 points, but the run was short-lived. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry continued to press things on the offensive end, leading the Warriors on a 10-0 run to end the third quarter with a 21-point advantage. Curry, who hit a long 3-pointer in transition over J.R. Smith late in the quarter, followed up the shot with a high-stepping celebration down the court. With that play in particular, he was looking more like the two-time M.V.P. and less like the meek performer who was outmatched throughout last year‚Äôs finals. With a quarter to play, he has 26 points and 8 assists while shooting 6 for 11 from 3-point range. LeBron James has picked up three fouls to go with his seven turnovers and is openly showing frustration on the court, yelling at the officials after Draymond Green appeared to commit an offensive foul against him with no call. For all three years he has coached the Warriors, Steve Kerr has been frustrated with his team‚Äôs tendency to lose concentration and commit needless turnovers to let opposing teams back into the game. In their first finals game with Kerr in the locker room rather than on the bench, the team is doing their coach proud, with just 4 turnovers against 26 assists and 10 steals. They are playing the efficient game Kerr has always preached while forcing Cleveland to commit 16 turnovers. We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Scott Cacciola OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî On the morning of what would prove to be their final day of the postseason, the Golden State Warriors held a voluntary shootaround at their practice site. Everyone showed up. At one point, Coach Steve Kerr made his way over to Andre Iguodala and asked him a simple question: ‚ÄúHow many minutes you got?‚Äù The Warriors were a few hours from facing the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals. In truth, Kerr‚Äôs question was more of a plea. He desperately wanted to close out the Cavaliers at home, and he hoped he could rely on Iguodala ‚Äî even more than usual ‚Äî to help make that happen. ‚ÄúWhatever you need,‚Äù Iguodala recalled telling Kerr. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù It was a subtle exchange that stuck with Iguodala, 33, as he prepared for the game. It gave him a good feeling, he said, knowing that his coach planned to lean on him. Sure enough, Iguodala went out Monday night and assembled one of the finest games of his career. He defended LeBron James. He hopped into his time machine and soared for dunks. He encouraged his teammates and enthralled the crowd. ‚ÄúAndre lives for the big moment,‚Äù his teammate Draymond Green said. By the end of the evening, Iguodala was a champion for the second time: Warriors 129, Cavaliers 120. He also made good on his pledge to Kerr, contributing 38 minutes 7 seconds of near-flawless playing time off the bench. He scored 20 points and shot 9 of 14 from the field. The Warriors outscored the Cavaliers by 18 points when he was on the court. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been so stressed the last three, four weeks,‚Äù Iguodala said. ‚ÄúI told my wife right after the game, like: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so sorry. It‚Äôs just been so stressful.‚Äô‚Äù If nothing else, Iguodala has a unique ability to channel that stress for the greater good. In Game 5, Kerr shortened his rotation. Ian Clark and JaVale McGee, who had been steady reserves throughout the postseason, did not shed their warm-ups. Instead, Kerr broke the emergency glass and summoned Iguodala to supply the most minutes he had in a game since December. In so many ways, Iguodala held it all together. ‚ÄúYou have to embrace it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just sacrificing to make sure everybody else is eating. But then you want to look for yourself sometimes. Like, you want to show people what you can do.‚Äù Iguodala is as much a symbol of the Warriors‚Äô willingness to sacrifice as anyone on the team. At the start of the 2014-15 season, which was Kerr‚Äôs first as the Warriors‚Äô coach, Kerr persuaded Iguodala, a former All-Star, to give up his role as a starter and come off the bench. Iguodala agreed to do it, and the Warriors went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the finals that season. Not only that, Iguodala was named the 2015 finals‚Äô most valuable player, thanks in large part to his defense on James. With another player, especially one of Iguodala‚Äôs caliber, Kerr‚Äôs decision could have caused problems ‚Äî or at least some drama. Some players do not want to be known as reserves. But Iguodala was willing to do it if he thought it would help the team. The experiment worked, of course. Iguodala has thrived as an anchor on the Warriors‚Äô second unit ever since. When Kevin Durant joined the Warriors this season, he came to regard Iguodala as a tangible example of their team-first approach. Iguodala also made sure to vocalize that message at times. Given the collection of talent on Golden State, there were games in which some All-Stars did not get as many shots as other All-Stars. ‚ÄúBut nobody cared as long as we won,‚Äù said Durant, who spotted Iguodala at the back of the room during his news conference late Monday night. ‚ÄúAndre Iguodala, who is right there ‚Äî he continued to preach that every single day: It‚Äôs all about the group. If your intentions are good, then that means, as a team, that we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.‚Äù The twist is that Iguodala tweaked his own advice for Durant as the playoffs moved forward. ‚ÄúAndre told me all the time: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs your time. Go take it. It‚Äôs about you,‚Äô‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄòNo, it‚Äôs about us. It‚Äôs about us. But I‚Äôm still going to be me.‚Äô‚Äù On Monday, Durant scored 39 points to cap his dominant postseason run. He was named the finals‚Äô M.V.P. Iguodala had one last assist in the game‚Äôs final minute. With the Warriors up by 14, Durant paused at one end of the court to collect himself. The moment was weighing on him. Iguodala reminded him to keep playing, to push through the emotion for at least a few more seconds. ‚ÄúBro,‚Äù Durant recalled responding to Iguodala, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre about to win the title.‚Äù The experience, of course, was new to Durant. Iguodala had been through it all before: the anxiety and the expectation, and then the relief mixed with joy. ‚ÄúThis is history,‚Äù Iguodala said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going down as one of the best teams ever, and that‚Äôs a special thing you cannot take away from us.‚Äù     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Jonah Engel Bromwich Less than a week after winning his first N.B.A. championship, one might expect Kevin Durant to be basking on an island somewhere, content that his off-season gamble to take up with the Golden State Warriors had paid off. But on Sunday night, Durant waded into the swamp of Twitter to have it out with fans who were still smarting about his departure last summer from the Thunder ‚Äî a team that he had played with for the entirety of its existence in Oklahoma City, where it moved in 2008. Over the course of several hours, Durant, the newly minted N.B.A. finals M.V.P., exchanged lighthearted jabs with those critics, in a lengthy and unusual show of social media spontaneity for a star athlete. In doing so, Durant nonchalantly confronted critics lobbing accusations that are likely to dog him for seasons to come: that he abandoned Oklahoma City for a super-squad in Oakland, and in doing so, handicapped his odds of winning a championship. ‚ÄúWhy you talking to people on Twitter like you some sort of validated champ? Your ring was given, not earned,‚Äù said one user, Troy Mineer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre soft bro. Soft.‚Äù When Durant, who averaged 35.2 points, 8.2 rebounds and 5.4 assists during the finals, responded with a play on the word ‚Äúvalidated,‚Äù the user became more emotional. ‚ÄúI had so much love for you man,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúI was your biggest fan and you did something I can‚Äôt respect. Why dude?‚Äù Another user urged Durant to stop acknowledging the critics, saying, ‚ÄúYou got the title bro‚Ä¶just leave the OKC people alone.‚Äù But Durant made it clear that he was not looking for advice on how to conduct himself. ‚ÄúRelax, I‚Äôm not new to this app,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúFall back.‚Äù The superstar had already seemed relatively comfortable in his new role as a villain. Just moments after the Warriors closed out the finals with a win in Game 5 last week, a new Nike commercial aired, responding to the barbs that have been slung at Durant over the course of his career. The ad ends with Durant silencing his critics by winning the championship, as the words, ‚ÄúDebate This‚Äù flash on the screen. But in the real world ‚Äî or at least on Twitter ‚Äî basketball fans are not so easily silenced. Durant‚Äôs longest exchange came with a self-identified Thunder fan, who called him a snake and a liar, compared him negatively to his former teammate Russell Westbrook and called his departure ‚Äúthe weakest move in sports.‚Äù Even as he continued to engage, Durant seemed wholly unburdened by the insults. ‚ÄúDo you have any friends?‚Äù he asked, in response to the name-calling. ‚ÄúTwitter followers don‚Äôt count, ok? Later in the night, a user named Dexter Loux asked him what many were likely thinking. ‚ÄúBruh you won a ring like a week ago,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúYou gotta have better stuff to be doing right now than arguing with people on here.‚Äù ‚ÄúNah I‚Äôm flying right now and the wifi kicked in,‚Äù Durant responded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do.‚Äù Follow Jonah Engel Bromwich on Twitter @Jonesieman    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper BERKELEY, Calif. ‚Äî While the price of Bitcoin has dropped since Christmas, the virtual currency boom has shown no signs of cooling off in the more august precincts of America‚Äôs elite universities. Several top schools have added or are rushing to add classes about Bitcoin and the record-keeping technology that it introduced, known as the blockchain. Graduate-level classes this semester at Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland, among other places, illustrate the fascination with the technology across several academic fields, and the assumption that it will outlast the current speculative price bubble. ‚ÄúThere was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin,‚Äù said David Yermack, a business and law professor at New York University who offered one of the first for-credit courses on the topic back in 2014. ‚ÄúBut within a few months, I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers, and the joking from my colleagues stopped after that.‚Äù For a class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up. He now has 225 people signed up for the class. A course about virtual currencies created by a Princeton computer science professor, Arvind Narayanan, has been the fifth-most-popular class on Coursera, an online learning site. And last month at the University of California, Berkeley, students were lining the walls and sitting in the aisles for the first lecture of ‚ÄúBlockchain, Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology, Business and Law.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,‚Äù Dawn Song, a computer science professor, told the students. ‚ÄúThere are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spot.‚Äù Because developments in the field are moving so fast, the business school professor also teaching the class, Greg La Blanc, said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasion. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt waiting until we perfect it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt compare it to the perfect blockchain course. Compare it to having no blockchain course at all.‚Äù The 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school, the business school and the engineering department, and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together. Ms. Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her department. The interest is a fueled by the rising price of virtual currencies over the last year. But they have created a host of issues that are worthy of study even apart from the price, professors in a variety of fields said. For lawyers, virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodity. Regulators have been caught flat-footed as entrepreneurs have raised billions of dollars by selling virtual currencies without going through the traditional fund-raising channels, taking advantage of the legal fuzziness surrounding them. For economists and business school professors, Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money. The first lecture in the Berkeley class, for example, considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money. Several business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is given credit for creating the first blockchain, a ledger of transactions that is updated by a network of computers without relying on any central company or government. Many big companies are now looking at how blockchains independent of Bitcoin might be used to do things like track music royalties or cargo containers with input from the many parties involved. ‚ÄúThe students in my class are from every possible discipline,‚Äù said Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke‚Äôs business school, who is teaching a class with 231 students this semester. ‚ÄúThey understand that this is going to disrupt many different areas of business, and they want to be the disrupters, not the disruptees.‚Äù The computer scientists, meanwhile, are digging into the cryptography that virtual currencies use to secure their wallets and transaction data, as well as the design of the distributed computer networks that make blockchains possible. Last week, Stanford University hosted a three-day conference on the architecture and security of blockchain software, part of a new cottage industry in academic conferences and journals that have sprung up. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to $2,‚Äù said Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, who is teaching a course on ‚ÄúCryptocurrencies, Blockchains and Applications‚Äù this semester. ‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs very cool from a technical standpoint.‚Äù Professors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities, familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job market. The job site Indeed.com has reported a spike in job listings that mention the blockchain, and there is now an entire site, Crypto Jobs List, dedicated to opportunities in the young industry. Vinny Tuminelli, a business school student sitting at the back of the Berkeley class, said that during an internship at Anheuser-Busch last summer, the blockchain had come up in an ‚Äúinnovation team‚Äù he was on. When he met with his supervisor more recently, the topic came up again. ‚ÄúMy original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword,‚Äù Mr. Tuminelli said. ‚ÄúBut now it seems like it has some legs behind it, and people are putting real resources toward it.‚Äù Students appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors. Berkeley students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology, taught by the students themselves. The director of M.I.T.‚Äôs Digital Currency Initiative, Neha Narula, said that when it didn‚Äôt schedule a course for this semester, she got constant requests from students. So she put one together and is now co-teaching it. ‚ÄúStudents are just fascinated with this area,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey want to learn about it desperately.‚Äù Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors By Richard Holden and Anup Malani The extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a ‚ÄúBitcoin bust‚Äù that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators. But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue. The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive. But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States ‚Äî estimated at 8.4 percent of output ‚Äî is relatively small compared with those of other countries. If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become ‚Äúthe next Swiss bank account.‚Äù The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions). Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C. A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., ‚ÄúI sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.‚Äù As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000. The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are ‚Äúarm‚Äôs length‚Äù counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules. It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be. One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product. More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs. A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code. The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion. More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult ‚Äî but no less necessary ‚Äî challenge.

Politics,"Advertisement By ALAN FEUERAPRIL 19, 2018  In early January, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer, filed a pair of lawsuits claiming that the political research firm Fusion GPS and the website BuzzFeed had defamed him by promoting the so-called Steele dossier, an intelligence report that alleged connections between Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates and Russia. The dossier depicted Mr. Cohen as a central figure in what it described as a conspiracy. In the suits, Mr. Cohen complained that Fusion GPS had disseminated the dossier to reporters and that BuzzFeed put it on the internet, even though both companies knew that it contained what Mr. Cohen believed were lies. But much has changed in the past three months. Just last week, Mr. Cohen discovered that he is now the subject of a federal investigation seeking to determine if he broke the law by trying to tamp down scandals involving women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. Because of that investigation, Mr. Cohen‚Äôs lawyer dropped both lawsuits in a sudden move on Wednesday night. ‚ÄúThe decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,‚Äù the lawyer, David M. Schwartz, said on Thursday. While Mr. Schwartz insisted that he still believes that BuzzFeed and Fusion GPS defamed Mr. Cohen, he added, ‚ÄúGiven the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Cohen‚Äôs chief complaint about the Steele dossier ‚Äî a series of papers written by Christopher Steele, a former British spy ‚Äî was its allegation that Mr. Cohen had secretly met last summer with a Russian official in Prague. Mr. Cohen has denied attending the meeting, and in one of the suits he said that the dossier‚Äôs defamatory claims turned him into ‚Äúcollateral damage in a U.S. political operation.‚Äù Advertisement At the time the suits were filed ‚Äî in Federal District Court in Manhattan and in State Supreme Court in Manhattan ‚Äî Mr. Cohen‚Äôs lawyer said that he had sought legal action because it was the only way that he could ‚Äúget back his reputation.‚Äù Last week, Fusion GPS responded with a court filing saying that the suit was barred by the statute of limitations and failed to ‚Äúallege actual malice.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The suit against BuzzFeed was dropped before the media outfit had a chance to respond. But in a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for BuzzFeed defended its decision to publish the Steele dossier, calling it an ‚Äúimportant part of the government‚Äôs investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.‚Äù The statement added that Mr. Cohen‚Äôs decision to end the suit ‚Äúsuggests that Donald Trump‚Äôs personal lawyer no longer thinks an attack on the free press is worth his time.‚Äù One result of dropping both complaints is that Mr. Cohen will not have to undergo discovery or be questioned by lawyers from either organization. The discovery process in defamation cases can often lead to depositions or the release of private documents and emails. In a separate case that also appeared related to the Cohen investigation, the tabloid news company American Media Inc. agreed on Wednesday to let a former Playboy model out of a contract that had kept her from talking freely about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump. As part of the agreement, the former model, Karen McDougal, dropped her own suit that claimed, among other things, that Mr. Cohen had inappropriately intervened in the initial deal to keep her silent. That deal and the extent of Mr. Cohen‚Äôs role in it are subjects of the broader federal probe looking into Mr. Cohen‚Äôs efforts to protect Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidential prospects in 2016.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter S. Goodman GENEVA ‚Äî The handsome stone edifice that serves as the headquarters for the World Trade Organization rises like a fortress over Lake Geneva, projecting an air of impregnability. But lately the institution looks vulnerable, sowing worries that global commerce itself may be in jeopardy. As the United States accuses China of predatory trading practices while doling out unilateral punishment, the trade organization tasked with preserving the peace appears marginalized. The latest indication came on Thursday, when President Trump effectively bypassed the trading organization in announcing plans to impose tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, from electronics to running shoes. By Friday morning, China was threatening to retaliate with tariffs on some $3 billion worth of imports from the United States. Diplomats and trade officials said the American action ‚Äî if followed through ‚Äî would flout W.T.O. rules, given that the United States would be imposing tariffs without first adjudicating its grievances. Chinese retaliation would similarly deviate from W.T.O. rules. The W.T.O. fancies itself a United Nations for global commerce, a place where its 164 member nations convene to hash out clear rules of engagement, seeking to defuse conflict. But as the United States and China, the two largest economies on earth, edge closer to a trade war, the organization established in 1995 to prevent such hostilities appears increasingly impotent. In an interview on Thursday, just before Mr. Trump‚Äôs announcement of the tariffs on China, the body‚Äôs director general, Roberto Azev√™do, expressed concerns that member states were taking matters into their own hands. ‚ÄúThese unilateral actions may lead to an escalation of trade-restrictive measures, ending up possibly in some kind of trade war,‚Äù Mr. Azev√™do said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm significantly concerned.‚Äù Mr. Trump appeared to acknowledge on Thursday that he was circumventing the rules-based trading system, asserting that the W.T.O. ‚Äúhas actually been a disaster for us.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very unfair to us,‚Äù he said. Yet, in a strange bit of cognitive dissonance, the Trump administration at the same time declared plans to seek justice from the body. The United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, said he planned to file a new case at the W.T.O. to try to halt Beijing‚Äôs policy of forcing foreign investors to transfer technology to China. The administration‚Äôs China offensive followed its decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. On Thursday, the administration significantly diminished the reach of those tariffs, exempting many of its allies ‚Äî not least, the European Union. But diplomats in Geneva said the damage to the global trading system went beyond the impact on metals, dealing a blow to the foundations of the W.T.O. The Trump administration has justified its steel and aluminum tariffs by claiming that American national security is imperiled by a dependence on imported metals. Trade experts have heaped scorn on that claim, noting that the United States already produces more than two-thirds of the steel it uses. The Trump administration‚Äôs invocation of national security broke with a deep-seated collective understanding that such claims are verboten as justification for tariffs. Once one country makes such a claim, the argument goes, others feel irresistible pressure to manufacture national security worries to protect their own industries. Trade disputes at the W.T.O. involving Russia and Ukraine will almost certainly feature the invocation of national security concerns to justify impediments to trade. The same goes for cases involving the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer unprecedented,‚Äù Mr. Azev√™do said. ‚ÄúBut I still believe this is not the best way to go.‚Äù Quiet and orderly, Geneva is generally not a place of drama. But recent weeks have generated anxiety and fear among the bureaucrats and diplomats who make up the trade organization. Many said Mr. Trump had effectively downgraded the W.T.O. to an optional stop that can be skipped by countries willing to break with rules and tradition in pursuit of self-interest. Many assumed that Mr. Trump was using extreme actions as a prelude to negotiation. They cited the fact that the steel and aluminum tariffs initially were to apply to every steel producer on earth and now apply to only a handful of countries, including China. Diplomats and trade organization officials acknowledge that the aggressive posture of the United States is in part an outgrowth of a substantial failure by the W.T.O. to update its rules to contend with China‚Äôs rise. Back in 2001, when China gained admission to the trade organization, it was supposed to be the beginning of a transformative opportunity for the world. China would gain access to global markets for its wares, while the rest of the planet would gain entry to China. Some argued that China‚Äôs integration into the world economy would encourage its leaders to further embrace market forces and eventually democracy. In the years since, China has absorbed staggering amounts of foreign investment ‚Äî much of it from the United States ‚Äî erecting factories that have churned out products shipped to ports around the world. But persistent impediments have limited the chances for foreign investors to cash in. China has forced foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese counterparts while transferring technology to China. Chinese state-owned companies have remained a central force in the Chinese economy, securing sweetheart credit arrangements from government-owned banks, cut-rate energy supplies and other subsidies. China‚Äôs president, Xi Jinping, has used its growing commercial might to redouble the power of the state, cracking down on dissent. Officials and diplomats now concede that the notion that inclusion in the global trading body would encourage China to embrace liberal values is a failure. But the consequences of that failure are sowing worries that the future of the rules-based trading system is on the line. The W.T.O. is the direct descendant of a global trading pact reached at the end of World War II, fueled by the idea that trade across borders minimizes prospects for war. ‚ÄúIf the member countries simply begin to take matters into their own hands, disregarding all these principles, all these concepts, we may be in a situation where the global economic environment could deteriorate very fast,‚Äù Mr. Azev√™do said. ‚ÄúThese measures tend to exacerbate nationalistic sentiments. They tend to exacerbate intolerance.‚Äù He fretted that the United States continued to block the appointment of new judges to a W.T.O. appellate body that renders judgment on trade disputes between countries. The United States has long complained that the process is slow and unfair, relying on archaic rules about fair pricing in the global economy. But Mr. Azev√™do said the Trump administration had offered no proposals for how to improve the process, while simply refusing to replace judges whose terms expired. ‚ÄúWhat is the point of having agreements if there is no means of promoting enforcement?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThe appellate body situation, if we don‚Äôt address it, could lead not now but in the future to a paralysis of the dispute settlement mechanism. This would compromise the whole system.‚Äù    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Julian Sanchez It‚Äôs a Hollywood clich√© that‚Äôs been adopted by villains from the trickster god Loki in Marvel‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù to James Bond‚Äôs ‚ÄúSkyfall‚Äù nemesis Raoul Silva: They are captured, only for the heroes to realize ‚Äî too late! ‚Äî that being caught was part of the villain‚Äôs evil plan all along. With Friday‚Äôs release of an indictment detailing Project Lakhta ‚Äî the information operations component of Russia‚Äôs efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth asking whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been reading from a similar script. The charging document released by the Justice Department names 13 Russian nationals associated with the innocuous-sounding ‚ÄúInternet Research Agency,‚Äù a team of well-funded professional trolls who carried out a disinformation campaign that spread from social media to real-world rallies. If there were any lingering doubts that Russia‚Äôs intervention was aimed at harming Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign and bolstering Donald Trump‚Äôs, an internal directive quoted in the indictment spells it out explicitly: ‚Äúuse any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump ‚Äî we support them).‚Äù That Russia should have preferred Mr. Trump‚Äôs victory to Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs is hardly a surprise: The real estate mogul had long been open in his fawning admiration for autocratic leaders generally and Mr. Putin in particular. But in any game of strategy, the best moves are those that accomplish multiple objectives. Friday‚Äôs indictment should serve as a reminder that Project Latkha didn‚Äôt merely aim to influence the outcome of the election, but also its tone, and Americans‚Äô attitudes toward their own democratic institutions. There‚Äôs a critical back story to Russia‚Äôs interference: A longstanding Kremlin grudge against Mrs. Clinton, cemented in 2011 when, as secretary of state, she cast doubt on whether Russia‚Äôs parliamentary elections, plagued by allegations of fraud and vote rigging, had been ‚Äúfree and fair.‚Äù The bulk of the Russian team‚Äôs online trolling efforts were directed at Mrs. Clinton, but the indictment notes that they also took aim at other, Republican candidates; Mr. Trump, Bernie Sanders and the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein, were spared. The trio had something more than opposition to Mrs. Clinton in common: A central theme of their campaigns was that the American political system is fundamentally rigged ‚Äî the same claim that had so incensed Mr. Putin. This same theme crops up in many of the Russian front groups‚Äô attacks: ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa caucus,‚Äù one social media post declared. One of the more memorable stunts the Russian team sponsored ‚Äî hiring an American to attend rallies dressed as Mrs. Clinton in prison garb, toting an ersatz jail cell ‚Äî fits the same pattern: She had to be cast not merely as an inferior candidate, but as a criminal who could win only through corruption. Mr. Trump was vehemently committed to the same message, not only leading those infamous chants of ‚ÄúLock her up!‚Äù but routinely declaring that if he were defeated ‚Äî which polls throughout the campaign suggested was the most likely outcome ‚Äî it would only be because Democrats had rigged the vote. In hindsight, it‚Äôs natural to think that Russia‚Äôs primary aim was to achieve the upset Trump victory we now know occurred. But if they were relying on the same polls as the rest of the world, they would have regarded that as a long-shot. It seems at least as likely that they hoped a strong showing would position a defeated Mr. Trump as a thorn in Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs side, casting a pall over the legitimacy of her administration by fuming publicly about how he had been cheated. (They probably could not have imagined that Mr. Trump would do this even in victory, insisting without any evidence that he had lost the popular vote only because of voter fraud.) If we run with the hypothesis that Russia‚Äôs core goal was to sow doubt about the integrity and fairness of American elections ‚Äî and, by implication, erode the credibility of any criticism aimed at Russia‚Äôs ‚Äî then the ultimate exposure of their interference may well have been viewed not as frustrating that aim but as one more perverse way of advancing it. Similar logic might account for Russian cyberattacks on many state voter registration systems ‚Äî first reported in June and more recently confirmed by Department of Homeland Security officials. There‚Äôs a consensus among cybersecurity experts that our unusually decentralized electoral system would make it extraordinarily difficult to surreptitiously change the result of a national election via hacking from abroad. But that might not be necessary: An attack might succeed just by creating widespread uncertainty about whether results had been altered, creating a crisis of legitimacy by the ultimate victor. United States intelligence officials themselves have voiced suspicions that Russia intended to be caught. ‚ÄúThey were unusually loud in their intervention,‚Äù James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, told Congress at a hearing last March. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost as if they didn‚Äôt care that we knew.‚Äù Wade into any online political discussion, where the conversation-ending accusation ‚ÄúRussian bot!‚Äù has become a commonplace, and it‚Äôs hard to deny that it‚Äôs worked. If this sounds plausible, we should also consider that our political response, too, may have been part of the plan. With President Trump dutifully refusing to implement retaliatory sanctions imposed on Russia by a large bipartisan majority in Congress, legislators have begun eyeing the online platforms on which so much disinformation spread. ‚ÄúYou created these platforms,‚Äù Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, railed at a panel of lawyers for Google, Facebook and Twitter in November, ‚Äúand now they‚Äôre being misused. And you have to be the ones who do something about it ‚Äî or we will.‚Äù That would be a final irony, and an unpleasant one. No less than our ‚Äúmeddling‚Äù in their internal elections, Russia has long resented United States criticism of the country‚Äôs repressive approach to online speech. Their use of online platforms to tamper with our presidential race reads not only as an attack, but as an implicit argument: ‚ÄúThe freedoms you trumpet so loudly, your unwillingness to regulate political speech on the internet, your tolerance for anonymity ‚Äî all these are weaknesses, which we‚Äôll prove by exploiting them.‚Äù Urgent as it is for the United States to take measures to prevent similar meddling in the next election, we should be careful that our response doesn‚Äôt constitute a tacit agreement.

Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the former emir of Qatar, founded the network in 1996 as an alternative, independent platform in the region. Al Jazeera (‚Äúthe Peninsula‚Äù in Arabic) refers to the Arabian Peninsula, comprising seven Arab nations in southwest Asia. Al Jazeera English, above, began in 2006. Al Jazeera America, unveiled in 2013, shuttered operations in 2016. While most of the Arab news media is controlled or censored by governments, Al Jazeera has drawn praise, and ire, as the first Arabic-language network to air voices critical of authoritarian regimes (although it steers clear of denouncing Qatar or members of its royal family). It has conducted interviews with Israeli politicians and members of the Taliban, and broadcast speeches from Osama bin Laden. After four Arab nations blocked access to Al Jazeera websites in June, the network responded with an open letter: ‚ÄúCountries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the U.A.E. may silence their own media,‚Äù it reads, ‚Äúbut because Al Jazeera is watched by so many people in the Arab world, they want us gone.‚Äù Sara Aridi contributed reporting. _____ This briefing was prepared for the European morning.

Politics,"Advertisement By EILEEN SULLIVANMAY 7, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump trained his rancor on federal investigators on Monday and appeared to warn that negative material would emerge about the prosecutors leading the inquiry into Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. In a series of Twitter posts on Monday, the president said the investigation was being run by Democrats and raised the question of whether the special counsel‚Äôs work was being drawn out to influence the outcome of the upcoming midterm congressional elections when Democrats could win enough seats to take control of the House and possibly the Senate. ‚ÄúJust wait ‚Äôtill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest,‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote in one of the early morning tweets.              The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‚Äòtill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!         The veiled threat to the special counsel leading the inquiry and the suggestion of bias comes at a time when Mr. Trump‚Äôs legal team seems to be struggling to present a consistent message to the American public.              Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!         The Republicans could lose control of the House and possibly the Senate in the upcoming elections, in part because of growing disapproval of the job Mr. Trump is doing. Mr. Trump‚Äôs approval rating is at 41 percent, the lowest of presidents at this point in their first terms since former President Jimmy Carter, who had a 40.5 percent approval rating at a comparable time in his administration. Advertisement There is no indication that the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, is being deliberately drawn out to manipulate votes. The special counsel‚Äôs office on Monday declined to comment on Mr. Trump‚Äôs question. Advertisement Mr. Trump regularly attacks the ongoing investigation, as he did on Monday, and has considered firing Mr. Mueller ‚Äî a looming threat that has divided the Republican Party. Mr. Trump has recently taken the position that what the special counsel is investigating as possible obstruction of justice is, in reality, Mr. Trump fighting back against what he considers to be false accusations. The president has said that the investigation is led by Democrats, even though Mr. Mueller is a longtime Republican. In another tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump said the Russia investigation is ‚Äúrapidly losing credibility‚Äù and referred to the Republican findings of the House Intelligence Committee ‚Äî specifically that in a yearlong investigation, Republicans on the committee found there was no collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. Democrats on the committee issued a dissenting document.              The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it‚Äôs called Fighting Back         Last year, the chairman of the panel Devin Nunes, of California, stepped away from leading the Russia investigation over questions about his own credibility to run a fair and bipartisan inquiry. Mr. Trump has previously railed about 13 ‚Äúhardened‚Äù Democrats on the special counsel team. At least 17 of the attorneys on the team have contributed to Democratic campaigns, according to records maintained by the Federal Election Commission. And three of the attorneys are registered Democrats, according to reports in the Washington Post and PolitiFact. But the political leanings of the other 14 are unclear. On Sunday, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump‚Äôs attorneys, also suggested there are problems with the government‚Äôs investigation. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,‚Äù Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor, said on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù ‚ÄúI happen to believe it‚Äôs greater than anybody realizes. Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Giuliani referenced a federal judge‚Äôs recent criticism of the special counsel‚Äôs fraud case against Mr. Trump‚Äôs former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said on Friday that Mr. Mueller was more interested in Mr. Manafort providing incriminating details about Mr. Trump than he is in Mr. Manafort‚Äôs fraud charges.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Steven Lee Myers BEIJING ‚Äî China‚Äôs leaders sound supremely confident that they can win a trade war with President Trump. The state news media has depicted him as a reckless bully intent on undermining the global trading system, while presenting the Chinese government as a fair-minded champion of free trade. And China‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, has used the standoff to reinforce the Communist Party‚Äôs message that the United States is determined to stop China‚Äôs rise ‚Äî but that it no longer can. China is already too strong, its economy too big. ‚ÄúChina is not afraid of a trade war,‚Äù the vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, declared at a news conference to discuss possible countermeasures. More than once, he cited the history of the ‚Äúnew China‚Äù ‚Äî which began its extraordinary economic revival four decades ago ‚Äî as evidence that it would ‚Äúnever succumb to external pressure.‚Äù Missing in the bluster and the propaganda are the questionable methods that China has adopted to squeeze foreign companies out of key technology markets ‚Äî and the fact that in the cold-eyed calculus of economics, China is more vulnerable to a trade war than officials admit. Exports account for a big share of Chinese economic growth. Because the United States buys so much from China, Washington has many more ways to hit Chinese manufacturers. By contrast, the retaliatory tariffs Beijing has proposed already cover more than one-third of what China buys from the United States, leaving it fewer options to strike back. In the political realm, however, Mr. Xi enjoys advantages that may allow him to cope with the economic fallout far better than Mr. Trump can. His authoritarian grip on the news media and the party means there is little room for criticism of his policies, even as Mr. Trump must contend with complaints from American companies and consumers before important midterm elections in November. The Chinese government also has much greater control over the economy, allowing it to shield the public from job cuts or factory closings by ordering banks to support industries suffering from American tariffs. It can spread the pain of a trade war while tolerating years of losses from state-run companies that dominate major sectors of the economy. ‚ÄúMy impression is that there is in Washington an exaggerated sense of how painful these tariffs might be‚Äù in China, said Arthur R. Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a research firm in Beijing. At worst, he estimated, the American actions could shave one-tenth of a percentage point off China‚Äôs economic growth ‚Äî hardly enough to force a drastic reversal of policies, given the enormous benefits that Chinese leaders see in the state-heavy economic model they have relied on in recent decades. At the same time, Chinese officials seem to believe they can take advantage of what they consider vulnerabilities in the American political system. ‚ÄúThe American agricultural sector is quite influential in the Congress,‚Äù said Wang Yong, a professor of economics at Peking University, explaining why China has targeted farm products such as soybeans with possible retaliatory tariffs. ‚ÄúChina wants the American domestic political system to do the work.‚Äù The president and his administration have sent drastically different messages this week. Hours after China‚Äôs announcement on Wednesday, administration officials sought to calm fears that a trade war was imminent, suggesting that they might not pull the trigger on a plan to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. But late Thursday, Mr. Trump said he would consider levying an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods in response to its ‚Äúunfair retaliation.‚Äù In a statement, he said, ‚ÄúRather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers.‚Äù Mr. Zhu, China‚Äôs vice minister of finance, this week had thanked American soybean farmers and the association that represents them for declaring their opposition to the Trump administration‚Äôs plan. In addition to soybeans, China threatened to retaliate with tariffs on American cars, chemicals and other products. The 106 goods, many produced in parts of the country that have supported Mr. Trump, were selected to deliver a warning that American workers and consumers would suffer in a protracted standoff. ‚ÄúIf anyone wants to fight, we will be there with him,‚Äù Mr. Zhu said, more or less outlining the terms for an American surrender: the removal of unilateral tariffs and a resolution of any grievances through the World Trade Organization. ‚ÄúIf he wants to negotiate, the door is open.‚Äù Globally, China‚Äôs strategy has been to isolate the United States, splitting it from allies in Europe and Asia who otherwise share American concerns about heavy-handed Chinese trade policies intended to protect key markets and to acquire technology from foreign firms. Mr. Kroeber said a united front against China would be more effective than American tariffs alone, but so far Mr. Trump has not managed to build one. Instead, Mr. Xi has largely succeeded in occupying the high moral ground on the world stage, projecting China as the sober-minded steward of international agreements on issues ‚Äî from global trade to climate change ‚Äî that Mr. Trump has been eager to walk away from. ‚ÄúThe American side is ready to launch a trade war at the slightest pretext,‚Äù the party‚Äôs flagship newspaper, People‚Äôs Daily, wrote in a blistering editorial on Thursday, condemning Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs as ‚Äútotally against the trend of economic globalization.‚Äù ‚ÄúToday, it targets China, and tomorrow may take aim at other countries,‚Äù it said. The party has also seized on the trade dispute as new evidence that the United States is intent on undermining China‚Äôs rise as a global power, a central narrative used to justify the party‚Äôs, and Mr. Xi‚Äôs, rule. In December, the state news media also highlighted the new National Security Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration, which declared that China ‚Äúsought to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven economic model, and reorder the region in its favor.‚Äù The document signaled a bipartisan shift in Washington‚Äôs posture toward China after decades of economic cooperation and concessions. The party has argued that the United States is only now challenging China because it fears losing its privileged place in the world order. ‚ÄúThe latest U.S. measures against China carry a sense of containment, which purportedly is commonplace among U.S. politicians,‚Äù said an editorial in Global Times, a nationalist state-run tabloid. ‚ÄúBut they have overlooked the fact that China has grown to be another economic center of the world.‚Äù It went on to note that China‚Äôs market was now ‚Äúno smaller or less attractive‚Äù than the American one ‚Äî a bit of an exaggeration perhaps, but not as big as it would have been a decade ago. And that makes the country a more formidable opponent than Mr. Trump may have anticipated. ‚ÄúTo take China down,‚Äù the editorial said, ‚Äúwould mean an unimaginably cruel battle for the U.S.‚Äù Follow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter: @stevenleemyers.

Technology,"Advertisement FEB. 2, 2018  RE: Cryptocurrency Steven Johnson wrote about the greater potential for blockchain. This is one of the best articles ever written on the potential of the technology that underlies Bitcoin. People are getting distracted by valuations of cryptographic currencies, but that‚Äôs not the point: The value of this technology is in self-executing contracts. This technology can replace banks, stock exchanges, insurance companies and other record-keeping organizations. Why would you need to do an I.P.O. if you can raise money through an I.C.O.? Why would you need a bank if you can keep your money securely in cryptographic currencies? This technology is set to disrupt and transform industries. This is bigger than the internet. Ravi Srivastava, West Hartford, Conn. Speaking as someone with a fair amount of academic background in distributed systems and databases, this entire debate is exasperating. Decentralization has been possible on the internet for decades without blockchain. The problem has been entirely a matter of economic, political and social choices to preference private, closed-source and centralized solutions because they‚Äôre easy and require zero effort. Moreover, and this is the critical mistake this article makes, the previous generation of web technologies (from Google forward) all uncritically tried to solve social and political problems with technology, a fool‚Äôs errand. Take the medical records example given in the article. The problem isn‚Äôt trust, security or verifiability, the things that blockchain can solve. The problem, contrary to what the author says, is actually that no one in the market has any incentive to interoperate. This sort of techno-optimism needs to die on the vine. Stop looking to technology to fix society. Go out and engage. Oreoluwa Babarinsa, Atlanta RE: Oregon Jennifer Percy wrote about the fear of the federal government among some ranchers in eastern Oregon. I grew up in rural Colorado and have lived in the western United States nearly my entire life. To a degree, I get where the people written about in this article are coming from; the West they believe in ‚Äî remote and desolate, yet awesomely beautiful and resource-rich, far from that icky urban environment ‚Äî is a familiar, comfortable home. But much of what they believe is demonstrably false. If all the federal land out West that‚Äôs not a military installation or a national park were devolved to the states or to private landowners, the locals would probably not stand to gain anything. If the states were to end up with federal lands, grazing and mineral-extraction fees would almost certainly go up, and by quite a bit. Could the federal government do a better job coordinating with local interests when it comes to the use of federal lands? Yes, but that doesn‚Äôt equate to the right to use the land to the point where it can no longer sustain either cattle or indigenous fauna or where streams that so many rely on for drinking water are polluted. Mark Janes, Guerneville, Calif. Like the author, I was born and raised in rural Oregon, and I share her idyllic love of the natural environment and the people of my home state. However, I took issue with the descriptions of the people at large, particularly the careers of the people of rural Oregon as stereotypes of a dying, white working class. There is a description of the people gathered at the high school in Redmond, Ore., as ‚Äúranchers, miners and loggers.‚Äù The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the people of Deschutes County in rural Oregon, which includes Redmond and the author‚Äôs hometown, Tumalo, do the same work as the rest of the country. Most people, at 16.6 percent, are in fields related to ‚Äúoffice and administrative support‚Äù (above the national average), and 0.2 percent are in ‚Äúfarming, fishing and forestry‚Äù (just below the national average of 0.3 percent). The people of rural Oregon work largely the same jobs that the rest of the country does: food service, sales, health, education, construction. I think it‚Äôs important when speaking of economic insecurities to accurately describe the economic reality that these stories exist in. Quincy Hayden, Springfield, Ore.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by The Shift By Kevin Roose An eon or two ago, Eastman Kodak was a bleeding-edge technology company. It hired the smartest engineers and put them to work racking up patents, pioneering new chemical processes and building a globe-spanning camera and film business that, at its peak, employed 145,000 people. But the digital photo age passed Kodak by, and today, the Rochester, N.Y., company exists mostly in the past tense. Many of the patents have been sold, buildings have been rented out or demolished, and the company has continued to shrink since it filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Now, the 130-year-old company is trying an unlikely sort of comeback ‚Äî one built by betting on cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a bold gamble that has excited some investors, perplexed others and raised questions about how closely Kodak vetted its cryptocurrency business partners, who now include a paparazzi photo agency, a penny-stock promoter and a company offering what has been called a ‚Äúmagic money making machine.‚Äù This month, Kodak lent its name to a digital currency called KodakCoin, which is billed as ‚Äúa photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.‚Äù The basic idea behind KodakCoin is to use the blockchain to help photographers manage their collections by creating permanent, immutable records of ownership. The company also struck a licensing deal for a Bitcoin-mining computer called the Kodak KashMiner, which allows users to generate their own cryptocurrency. Kodak‚Äôs stock rose more than 200 percent following the announcements, and has not fallen much since. That‚Äôs partly because the blockchain ‚Äî the mathematical ledger system that forms the basis of digital currencies ‚Äî has a kind of talismanic effect in today‚Äôs stock market. As investors seek to capitalize on the popularity of currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, a number of struggling companies have reversed their fortunes, at least temporarily, simply by adding ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to their names or announcing a new cryptocurrency venture unrelated to their previous line of work. (The most notorious example is Long Island Iced Tea Corp., a beverage company that tripled its value overnight after it rebranded itself ‚ÄúLong Blockchain Corp.‚Äù) These sudden, brazen moves have also attracted the attention of regulators. In a recent speech, Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the agency was ‚Äúlooking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology.‚Äù Kodak is the most prominent old-line company to enter the cryptocurrency game so far, and maybe the most controversial. Almost immediately, critics pounced on the company‚Äôs plans, characterizing them as a desperate money grab. ‚ÄúIt feels like a publicly traded company issuing a token to raise its stock price from the grave,‚Äù said Kyle Samani, a partner at the cryptocurrency trading firm Multicoin Capital. ‚ÄúI would not be sleeping very well if I was involved in this,‚Äù said Jill Carlson, a blockchain consultant. In an interview, Jeff Clarke, Kodak‚Äôs chief executive, said that the company‚Äôs blockchain ambitions were genuine. He began looking into blockchain technology last summer, he said, and realized that it could solve a perennial problem for photographers ‚Äî proving ownership of their images, tracking down copyright violators, and getting paid. ‚ÄúThis is not a dog food company that‚Äôs creating a currency,‚Äù Mr. Clarke said. ‚ÄúThis is a real solution around digital rights management that Kodak has been involved in for many years.‚Äù In theory, photographers will be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne, create a blockchain-based license for each image, and use web-crawling software to scour the internet looking for copyright violations. Instead of using dollars, photographers can have clients pay them in KodakCoins. KodakCoin‚Äôs initial offering, scheduled for Wednesday, is expected to raise as much as $20 million. (On Tuesday night, KodakCoin‚Äôs website said that it would delay the offering by ‚Äúseveral weeks‚Äù to verify the credentials of potential investors.) But there are few details about what that money will be used for, or why a similar system could not be built without the blockchain. There is also a more obvious question: Why would photographers want to be paid in digital tokens, rather than cash? In several calls with KodakCoin leaders, I couldn‚Äôt get straight answers to these questions. And KodakCoin‚Äôs white paper, a technical document that details the plans for the currency, is a 40-page mishmash of marketing buzzwords and vague diagrams, like the one below: Make no mistake: Digital rights management is a real issue for photographers, and the blockchain does, in theory, offer a compelling solution. But the specific attributes of KodakCoin present some red flags. First, despite the name, KodakCoin is not actually a Kodak project. The company behind the offering, WENN Digital, is a California-based affiliate of a British photo agency that specializes in paparazzi photo licensing. Under their licensing agreement, Kodak will not receive any direct revenue from the public offering. It will receive a minority stake in WENN Digital, 3 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a royalty on future revenue. Cameron Chell, a lead adviser to the KodakCoin project, told me that the initial offering represented a ‚Äúseminal moment‚Äù for Kodak, and that the company‚Äôs interest in blockchain technology was a savvy long-term investment. ‚ÄúThe real story is that it‚Äôs about to be a renaissance,‚Äù he said. But Mr. Chell, a Canadian entrepreneur and motivational speaker who once opened for Tony Robbins, has a troubled track record. In 1998, Mr. Chell agreed to a five-year ban from the Alberta Stock Exchange in Canada and paid a $25,000 fine in connection with a violation of the exchange‚Äôs rules. A previous company of his ended in ignominy after its chairman was  charged with fraud. Asked about these incidents, Mr. Chell said that he was ‚Äúyoung, inexperienced and was irresponsible in my actions,‚Äù and that he had ‚Äúlearned a lot since 1998 and work hard to conduct myself in a manner that does not reflect that poor judgment.‚Äù A Kodak spokesman did not return a request for comment about Mr. Chell and whether it knew about the ban. Mr. Chell has refashioned himself as a blockchain expert in recent years, and KodakCoin is his biggest project so far. He is the chairman of Appcoin Innovations, which was registered as a literary agency ‚Äî Redstone Literary Agents ‚Äî until last year, when it became a consulting firm that provides ‚Äúa turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,‚Äù according to securities filings. The company, which trades over the counter as a penny stock, earned no revenue in 2015 or 2016, according to S.E.C. filings. Appcoin Innovations is slated to receive 20 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a portion of the offering proceeds, a stake that could amount to millions if the offering is successful. ‚ÄúOnce formally launched,‚Äù Mr. Chell wrote to me in an email, ‚Äúthe company will hopefully provide shareholders a traditional and transparent place to participate in the crypto space with projects that are regulatory compliant.‚Äù Now, about those coins. You might think that a digital currency that is trying to ‚Äúdemocratize photography and make licensing fair to artists,‚Äù in Mr. Clarke‚Äôs words, would be easily accessible. But because of regulatory requirements, KodakCoins will be available only to so-called accredited investors in the United States. An accredited investor is defined as a person with a net worth of $1 million or more, or an annual income above $200,000. How many cryptocurrency-obsessed millionaire photographers do you know? Even if photographers do meet the requirements to participate, they could have a hard time spending their KodakCoins, or redeeming them for cash. The S.E.C. has warned that securities sold in private offerings, such as KodakCoins, may be difficult to resell ‚Äî and that investors may be required to hold on to them ‚Äúindefinitely.‚Äù A KodakCoin representative told me that the company believes its tokens will eventually be freely traded, and that it may issue other types of tokens in the future that will not be subject to the same restrictions. KodakCoin‚Äôs white paper says that token holders may receive other benefits, such as a share of KodakOne‚Äôs revenue and access to a ‚Äúmarketplace‚Äù that will allow them to spend their KodakCoins on camera equipment, studios for photo shoots, and travel expenses. But these benefits could fail to materialize. Cryptocurrency experts also do not seem impressed with the Kodak KashMiner, a Bitcoin-mining machine advertised at this year‚Äôs CES electronics trade show. According to the advertisement, users will pay $3,400 to rent the machine, a Kodak-branded computer that solves complex math equations to unlock new Bitcoin, for two years. Half the Bitcoins successfully mined with the Kashminer will go back to Spotlite, the company licensing Kodak‚Äôs name, and the user will keep the other half. Kodak hasn‚Äôt shared many details about its KashMiner deal. But renting the machines could be a hard sell. In its CES advertisement, KashMiner estimates that each renter will earn $9,000 from mining Bitcoin over the two-year contract window. Experts told me that figure was most likely inflated, because Bitcoin mining gets harder over time. And they pointed out that the KashMiner itself appears to simply be a rebranded version of a popular Bitcoin-mining machine that can be purchased outright for less than the rental cost. All of this ‚Äî the origins of KodakCoin, the currency itself and the lofty claims about the KashMiner‚Äôs moneymaking potential ‚Äî adds up to a big question mark, and points to the possibility that Kodak may be in over its head. ‚ÄúThe best-case scenario is that they believe that the technology will eventually be able to deliver what they‚Äôve pitched,‚Äù said Ms. Carlson, the blockchain consultant. ‚ÄúThe worst-case scenario is that they are just being very opportunistic.‚Äù Mr. Clarke, Kodak‚Äôs chief executive, characterized the blockchain projects as a small part of the company‚Äôs overall strategy, and said it was ‚Äúironic‚Äù that critics were faulting Kodak for embracing a young technology like cryptocurrency, given that its past problems were caused by a failure to innovate. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt speculative,‚Äù Mr. Clarke said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking an emerging new technology in blockchain, and we‚Äôre using it to solve a real problem.‚Äù Email Kevin Roose at kevin.roose@nytimes.com, or follow him on Facebook at facebook.com/kevinroose and on Twitter: @kevinroose.

Sports,"Advertisement  On Pro Basketball  By                       HARVEY ARATON   JUNE 8, 2017  When Kevin Durant rose for a 3-point shot that froze LeBron James in his Nike-sponsored tracks and ultimately drained the remaining tension from the N.B.A. finals late Wednesday night, he all but punctuated the message that this was his time and his title, and that he had leveraged his way onto what remains a perfect postseason team. James called Durant‚Äôs audacious launch from the left wing with 45.3 seconds remaining in Game 3 ‚Äúa bomb in transition,‚Äù and it was. Once again in the fourth quarter, Durant had outplayed and outlasted James and, in the larger sense, outmaneuvered the league‚Äôs reigning master of free-agent mobility. James, in 2010, had perfected a longstanding tradition of pro basketball‚Äôs best players wielding leverage like a weapon, raising it to a new commercial level while bolting Cleveland for Miami. There, he won two championships with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. He then returned home to northeast Ohio and might well have been defending consecutive titles ‚Äì not just last year‚Äôs ‚Äì over the last week had the Cavaliers not lost Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving to injuries in the first of this fascinating trilogy with the Golden State Warriors. But Durant‚Äôs much-debated and derided move to the Warriors from Oklahoma City dramatically rewrote the sport‚Äôs competitive equation, not unlike a fair number of leading men have done before. James more or less conceded that when he said, in the aftermath of Wednesday‚Äôs crushing 118-113 defeat, ‚ÄúI played against some great teams, but I don‚Äôt think no team has had this type of firepower.‚Äù Advertisement He also understands, better than anyone, that the criticism of Durant for bidding Oklahoma City and Russell Westbrook adieu weeks after the Thunder had surrendered a 3-1 Western Conference finals lead to the Warriors last season was overdone and historically ignorant. Advertisement The great players in the N.B.A. have always understood how to exploit their muscle, one way or another. From much of the reaction to Durant‚Äôs decision, you would have thought no other ring-less superstar had ever jilted a rising league power, but that large, smiling man sitting behind the ABC broadcast team Wednesday night was a useful reminder otherwise. Granted, in bolting Orlando for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal didn‚Äôt enlist with the team that had just ambushed his arena, but, really, what‚Äôs the difference? What‚Äôs wrong with a player using his collectively bargained freedom from the much richer owners to choose a team he envisions as a better fit for him in a place he believes is more desirable in which to live? In the pre-free-agent days, Wilt Chamberlain moved, West to East and then East to West. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar brooded his way out of Milwaukee, to the Lakers, where he teamed with Magic Johnson to win five titles. The folks who would tell you that Kobe Bryant would never have left the Lakers forget that he threatened to on occasion and manipulated the entire draft process to get there in the first place. No question, Durant‚Äôs Oklahoma City departure has contributed mightily to a competitively lopsided postseason, with the Warriors, now 15-0, and the Cavaliers blowing through conference play and the Warriors just one victory from an unprecedented four-series sweep. The guess is James and the Cavaliers will fight hard to prevent that in Game 4 on Friday night, the league will survive if it happens and its fan base will eventually look back in awe. As Adam Silver, the league‚Äôs commissioner, said last week, ‚ÄúThe fan in me would love to see more competition at times, but on the other hand, I‚Äôve said it before, I think we should also celebrate excellence. ‚ÄúI also think these things have a way of working themselves out,‚Äù he added. It‚Äôs entirely possible the Warriors are embarking on a run to match or exceed what Michael Jordan achieved in Chicago across the 1990s. They are young and apparently selfless enough, but we‚Äôll see how success impacts them and how the more smartly run franchises in the league respond.

The life span of envisioned indestructibility is always in question, as Mike Tyson proved, and later Tiger Woods. For a very long time now, James has been thought to be indefatigable, the basketball specimen impervious to frailty. But, at 32, the do-it-all quality of his play and the magnitude of his effort is finally taking its toll, exacerbated by the energy-sapping burden presented by Durant at both ends of the court, and by the Warriors over all. Steve Kerr, the Warriors‚Äô coach, was speaking of Kyrie Irving and James, who together scored 77 points over a combined 90 minutes in Game 3, when he said: ‚ÄúBoth those guys were amazing, 38 and 39. But that takes a lot out of you. We just kept telling the guys, they‚Äôre going to get tired. Stay in front of them. Force them into outside shots, if you can. Fatigue will play a role.‚Äù Advertisement James had scoffed at the question of fatigue before Game 3, reminding a reporter that he had averaged a triple double in the first two games, snapping: ‚ÄúDo I look tired?‚Äù The proof is in the performance. James‚Äôs last field goal Wednesday night came with 6 minutes 54 seconds remaining. He missed a very makable step-back 12-footer in the lane at the 1:29 mark and the Cavaliers up, 113-109. His legs didn‚Äôt respond fast enough to Durant on the game‚Äôs pivotal possession. Durant outscored him by 14-7 in the fourth quarter, (and by 31-11 in the period over three games). Of Durant, Kerr said: ‚ÄúYou can tell he knows this is his moment. He‚Äôs been an amazing player in this league for a long time, and I think he‚Äôs ‚Äî he senses this ‚Äî is his time, his moment, his team. ‚ÄúWhen I say his team, I mean it‚Äôs not literally just his team,‚Äù Kerr added. ‚ÄúWe got a group around him that can help him and create space for him with the shooting and the playmaking, and I think he‚Äôs having the time of his life out there.‚Äù In a nutshell, Kerr was asking, what is so wrong with an era in which the truly great players prefer to share the ball and the burden, as opposed to those post-Jordan years when one roster often wasn‚Äôt big enough for two franchise stars, and when we said his team, we meant literally just his team? The Warriors have raised the bar on the drafting, development and acquiring of star-laden talent. And now James is almost out of time and chances to stop Durant, the Warriors‚Äô finishing piece, from holding up the trophy and telling him, among others, your move.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Sports of The Times By Michael Powell OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî A couple of hours before Game 2 of the N.B.A. finals, I watched Kevin Durant go through a balletic exercise. The latest superstar addition to the Golden State Warriors balanced on one foot about 18 feet from the basket. An assistant tossed a basketball at him, which he caught without losing his balance. Then, still on one foot, he shot at the basket. Durant hit about 80 percent of those shots. The casual nature of this exercise was breathtaking, and it gave me a visual context for an exchange early in the fourth quarter on Sunday night. Durant found himself isolated on defense against the Cavaliers‚Äô Kevin Love. A power forward, Love possesses a lovely bag of low-post tricks; he deked and spun and put up a hook shot. Durant leapt and inhaled that shot. Then this man who is seven foot tall dribbled the length of the court. A couple of Cavaliers hit him and as Durant fell toward the court, he put up a butter-soft shot. It twirled through the hoop. Durant, of course, shot off one foot. It was at that point, early in the fourth quarter, that I felt officially sorry for the Cavaliers. This finals matchup was billed as Godzilla versus Mothra III, the best of the West against the best of the East, who also are the reigning world champs. It appears Mothra slept in. The Golden State Warriors are like a weapons factory, with simply too great an abundance of brilliant and intelligent athletes. Prime among those weapons is Durant, who came to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City last summer. He is a spindly wonder of hoops precision. To add him to a team that won 73 games and lost just 9 the season before seemed to be an exercise in excess. That was correct. In this postseason, the Warriors can go slack for seven or eight minutes at a time, their passes flaccid, their shot-making a little off. Then the ball starts whipping about on the perimeter, and zipping inside, and they come upon an opponent like a summer storm. So it was on Sunday. Midway through the third quarter, the Cavaliers, who after all still have the best player in this corner of the Milky Way, had held their own. LeBron James had put up a golden pile of statistics, passing like the reincarnation of Magic Johnson and barreling to the basket like the 9:04 out of Erie. Steve Kerr, the Warriors‚Äô coach, talked afterward of drawing plans to stop James, which amounted to sketching some Xs and Os for his players and wishing them luck. ‚ÄúYou could see the force that he brought to the game,‚Äù Kerr said. ‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs like that, not a whole lot you can do.‚Äù Still there is that summer storm problem. It arrived with the Cavaliers down by just four points, 86-82, with 5 minutes 42 seconds left in the third quarter. At which point 3-point shots fell like hail and passes whipped like storm winds and five minutes later, Golden State was up, 102-88. The Cavaliers, for all intents and purposes, had been blown into San Francisco Bay. Someone writing under my byline in The New York Times predicted last week that the Cavaliers would win this series in seven games (I blame Russian hackers). And in fact, the teams‚Äô stars are not so different. Durant is a multitalented marvel, but LeBron, at 32, still stalks the court with artful anger. Kyrie Irving lacks the playmaking ability of Stephen Curry, but his twisting, now-you-see-it-now-you-don‚Äôt ball-handling and loving use of the backboard call to mind a latter-day Earl Monroe. The Cavaliers‚Äô supporting cast is another matter. The Warriors come at you in waves: Durant and Curry. And Klay Thompson and his metronomic jumper. And Draymond Green and his exuberant passion and smarts, and Andre Iguodala, a former N.B.A All Star. And so on it goes, like an army with unending reinforcements. The Cavaliers‚Äô bench is less formidable. J.R. Smith was oft-injured this past season and took just two shots in Game 2 and made none. Iman Shumpert is the putative defensive stopper. He came into the league needing to find go-to offensive moves. He is still searching. When Durant blocked Love‚Äôs hook shot, the game‚Äôs result was sealed. Durant hit a 3-point shot in the face of James and then Curry came down and launched a 3-point shot from San Leandro. It hit just net. I confess to some ambivalence about Curry. He is a loose-limbed twirling top of a player, and at his best the Pharoah Sanders of this team, a free-jazz innovator. At the same time, his Rockette leg kicks and preening and chest-bumping ‚Äî at one point he beat James off the dribble and all but lathered himself in self-praise ‚Äî are a bit much. I sat in the news conference pillbox afterward and heard Curry talk about that play. He confessed that he had come into the locker room at halftime feeling down, after making a number of ill-advised passes. Coach Kerr, he said, had spread his gospel of joyous hooping. ‚ÄúCoach got on me at half time about my body language and just trying to play with passion and play with joy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe turnovers kind of got under my skin.‚Äù So he celebrated. And who am I to say it doesn‚Äôt work? The Cavaliers offered no talk of unconditional surrender. They came back last year and won the championship series after dropping the first two games to these same Warriors. Although, of course, any team that adds Kevin Durant is not the same team. James skipped the interview room, preferring to answer questions bare-chested by his locker as approximately 194 reporters and camera and sound people gathered around. A reporter felt compelled to ask James this question: Do you feel that the Cavaliers have to defend their home court now? James shot him the sort of look you reserve for your really slow Uncle Jimmy. ‚ÄúWell, are you a smart guy?‚Äù James asked. You could feel the reporter wince. ‚ÄúI think so?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt defend home court,‚Äô James asked, ‚Äúthen what happens?‚Äù Then you guys lose, the reporter replied. James nodded. ‚ÄúAll right, so that answers your question.‚Äù It also points to the monumental challenge confronting the reigning N.B.A. champions.   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board Since announcing new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports last week, the Trump administration has argued that it is protecting American industry from China, which in recent years flooded the global market with cheap metals. It is impossible to take this argument seriously. For starters, the tariffs will have little impact on China. That country supplies less than 5 percent of the steel and about 10 percent of the aluminum that the United States imports. Further, a vast majority of metal imports from China are already subject to tariffs put into place by previous administrations, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Oddly, the primary victims of these tariffs, which are being imposed under a law that lets the president restrict trade to protect national security, will be American allies like the European Union and South Korea. Canada and Mexico will be temporarily exempted, but could still be hit with tariffs later if they and the United States fail to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Before President Trump signed orders authorizing the tariffs on Thursday, he suggested other countries could be exempted, too, but only if they treated the United States ‚Äúfairly,‚Äù including by spending more money on their own defense. ‚ÄúMany of the countries that treat us the worst on trade and on military are our allies as they like to call them,‚Äù he said at the White House, flanked by steel and aluminum workers and administration officers. More important, the Trump administration has repeatedly dropped the ball on efforts that might have succeeded in prompting China to curb production, something that would have benefited not just the United States but also allies that are now threatening to retaliate by imposing tariffs on American goods and services. Most experts agree that China is not moving fast enough to close steel mills and aluminum smelters that it no longer needs because its economy is growing more slowly as it has gotten much bigger. The country‚Äôs leaders fear that moving faster could hurt its economy, harm state-owned banks that have lent to the metal industries and create unrest among workers who lose their jobs. But experts like Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University, say that the United States, the European Union and other countries could pressure China to move faster to address this problem, especially if they worked together. Characteristically, the Trump administration has displayed none of the diplomatic and economic savvy required to get China to change its policies. On Jan. 12, 2017, the Obama administration filed a case with the World Trade Organization that accused China of unfairly subsidizing aluminum producers and thus driving down global prices for the metal. But Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has failed to ask the W.T.O. to convene a panel of judges to hear the case, effectively suspending it. Mr. Lighthizer‚Äôs office declined to answer questions about the case. Perhaps Mr. Lighthizer, a trade lawyer who has represented the steel industry, did not believe the case would have been successful because he shares Mr. Trump‚Äôs contempt for the W.T.O., an organization the United States was instrumental in creating to help prevent trade wars. Last month, Mr. Trump said the organization ‚Äúmakes it almost impossible for us to do good business,‚Äù arguing that American officials get to pick too few judges on its dispute resolution panels. But these assertions are belied by the fact that the United States has won nearly 86 percent of the cases it has brought before the W.T.O. since 1995. Another opportunity for addressing excess steel production came in talks last summer between Chinese officials and Mr. Trump‚Äôs commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. The Chinese told the Americans they would be willing to reduce China‚Äôs steel production capacity by 150 million tons by 2022. But Mr. Trump rejected the offer. An unnamed administration official told The Financial Times that Mr. Trump wasn‚Äôt interested in striking a deal because he had already decided that he wanted to impose tariffs. By now it should surprise no one that Mr. Trump prefers empty statements to doing the work needed to achieve lasting change. The former is easy to deliver in tweets and public pronouncements, while the latter takes patience and persistence. The president would rather impose tariffs and claim he is protecting the country and bringing back lost jobs than take the time to properly address the problem of excess Chinese steel and aluminum capacity. And he does not seem to care that, in doing so, he might penalize and anger an ally like South Korea, with which the United States needs to work closely on potential negotiations with North Korea, an unpredictable adversary. The president‚Äôs approach should worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Victor Mather With a 118-113 N.B.A. finals Game 3 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night, the Golden State Warriors closed in on the N.B.A. championship. And they closed in on history. They have a chance to be the first team to go through the playoffs undefeated. Should they succeed with a win Friday night in Cleveland, they would complete back-to-back seasons to remember: the greatest regular season record ever (73-9 in 2015-16) followed by the greatest playoff record ever. Indeed, their playoff run would stand as probably the greatest in any major North American sport. Previously, the best N.B.A. playoff record belonged to the 2000-1 Lakers of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. They raced through the first three rounds undefeated, lost Game 1 of the finals to Allen Iverson and the 76ers, then won four straight for a 15-1 record. In a three-round playoff format, the 1982-83 Sixers were 12-1, nearly making good on Moses Malone‚Äôs prediction of ‚Äúfour, four, four.‚Äù The sport with the most similar playoff format to basketball is hockey. No team has swept through the Stanley Cup playoffs in its current four-round format; the record belongs to the 1988 Oilers (Gretzky, Messier, Kurri) who were 16-2-1. (The tie came because of a power failure in the Boston Garden.) Earlier records all belong to the Canadiens. The 1976 and 1968 teams each had only one loss in a three-round format. The 1960 Canadiens were the last team to be undefeated in the postseason, though the playoffs were just two rounds then. Under the current baseball format, the closest teams to perfection were the 2005 White Sox and 1999 Yankees, who each lost just once in three rounds. Tie goes to the White Sox, who were winning their first title since 1917. Their only loss, to the Angels in the League Championship Series, came by a single run. In the older two-round format, the 1976 Big Red Machine in Cincinnati was undefeated in seven games. The N.F.L. playoffs is single elimination, so by definition all winning teams are undefeated. As for dominance, it would be tough to match the Bears of 1985, who won their three playoff games by 21-0, 24-0, and 46-10. Major League Soccer is a young league, with a shifting playoff format. The 2011 Galaxy are the only team who were undefeated and untied in regulation time in the playoffs, leading to David Beckham‚Äôs first M.L.S. Cup. Several teams have been unbeaten in the W.N.B.A. playoffs, most recently the Minnesota Lynx in 2013 at 7-0. The Warriors are likely to be favored by about three points in Friday‚Äôs game. Should they finish a staggering fourth consecutive sweep, they will have put up a mark that teams in any sport will find extraordinarily difficult to rival.

Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSAPRIL 27, 2018, 5:52 A.M. E.D.T.  LONDON/NEW YORK/SINGAPORE ‚Äî  After bouncing up, falling down and keeping investors on the edges of their seats, bitcoin may be maturing into a period of relatively boring stability, experts say. A worldwide wave of regulation has led to a collapse in trading volumes. Cryptocurrency advertisements are disappearing from top internet pages, and bitcoin no longer dominates Google searches. As investors try to figure out what bitcoin wants to be when it grows up, the best-known cryptocurrency is going through somewhat of an existential crisis. ""It needs a new narrative,"" said Nicholas Colas, New York-based founder of investment research firm DataTrek. ""There is every chance that if there is some sort of institutional involvement, there could be a move higher."" Advertisement Bitcoin rallied 25 percent in April after crashing 70 percent from a high near $20,000 late last year. Advertisement The cryptocurrency landscape has indeed changed. Mom-and-pop investors who drove bitcoin's skyrocket rise in 2017 have been pushed aside by government bans on trading, and replaced by cryptocurrency funds, wealthy individuals and established financial firms. The bigger players can make bigger moves, but their trades are often obscured by screens on over-the-counter (OTC) brokerages and matching platforms. They are also less likely to chase sudden swings in bitcoin's value, being more interested in the potential of  unproven but promising blockchain technology. Average daily traded volumes across cryptocurrency exchanges fell to $9.1 billion in March and to $7.4 billion in the first half of April, compared with almost $17 billion in December, according to data compiled by crypto analysis website CryptoCompare. Several exchanges saw their daily trading volumes drop by more than half between December and March, including Bitfinex, Poloniex, Coinbase and Bitstamp, the data shows. Cryptocurrencies' biggest-ever trading day was Dec. 22, when volumes topped $30 billion, according to CryptoCompare. On April 8, volume sagged to $4.6 billion, the weakest day since last October, according to the data. Advertisement RESHAPING THE MARKET The theory that bigger institutions will make bitcoin markets less volatile and more liquid has grown as new OTC exchanges spring up, carrying names such as Circle, Octagon Strategy, Cumberland and Kraken. Digital exchange Gemini's new block trading product allows high-volume trades that will be invisible to other traders until the orders are filled.

Cumberland, one of the biggest block traders, has counterparties in more than 35 countries and quotes two-way prices in about 35 crypto assets. Gatecoin, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, saw retail volumes plunge from peaks of $100 million a day last September, said Aurelien Menant, its founder and chief executive. But, he said, as institutional players enter the market, OTC trades hidden from view have pushed up overall volumes in a way that doesn't show up in data. Gatecoin also operates an OTC platform. Few institutions have gone public about their plans to trade cryptocurrencies, and many asset managers say they still aren't sure the digital currency is more than a fad. But a Thomson Reuters survey this week found one in five financial institutions is considering trading cryptocurrencies in the next 12 months. Of those, 70 percent said they planned to start trading in the next three to six months. In the meantime, the price of bitcoin may be stabilizing, at least on paper. The futures market <BTCc1> shows bitcoin staying nearly flat - between $8,900 and $9,050 - until September. Gatecoin's Menant, however, is considerably more bullish. He reckons the currency might end the year above $100,000, but acknowledges that's a gamble. Advertisement UNDERLYING VALUE Joe Duncan, founder of Singapore-based Fintech firm Duncan Capital, expects to see retail investors return to trading as governments slowly relax their cryptocurrency rules. ""But bitcoin could still lose some market dominance,"" Duncan said. Thomas Lee, managing partner and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors in New York, said the bitcoin market is languishing in a ""purgatory"" phase somewhere between a bear and a bull market. He predicted that could continue until at least September. One issue is that although many of the big institutions are curious about how bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology could revolutionize the financial sector, bitcoin isn't widely accepted as currency and has no intrinsic value. That, and the currency's intense volatility, make it challenging for investors to forecast a price. Some analysts think bitcoin will retain a premium as a security, like gold, in the digital world, while other cryptocurrencies are used for commerce. Others see it as just another asset. ""One of the reasons to own cryptocurrencies is because they are an effective hedge,"" said Sam Doctor, a data analyst at New York-based Fundstrat, a research firm whose founder is a well-known bitcoin bull predicting large rises this year. ""Until something happens to disprove that thesis, you aren't looking to sell them so long as other asset classes are falling.""

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters MANILA ‚Äî The Philippines will allow 10 blockchain and virtual currency companies to operate in an economic zone to take advantage of tax perks while generating employment, a government official said on Wednesday. The companies would be the first virtual currency firms to operate in the Philippines after regulators legalized their entry into an economic zone in February, in contrast to neighboring countries which have not allowed such entities. ""We are about to license 10 platforms for cryptocurrency exchange. They are Japanese, Hong Kong, Malaysians, Koreans,"" Raul Lambino, chief of the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA), told Reuters. ""They can go into cryptocurrency mining, initial coin offerings, or they can go into exchange,"" Lambino said. But the exchange of fiat money into virtual currency, and vice versa, should be done offshore to avoid infringing Philippine regulations, he said. The CEZA, a state agency which manages the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport in the northeastern tip of the Philippines, in February created rules allowing virtual currency companies to set up offices and facilities in the zone.  They should invest at least $1 million over two years and pay up to $100,000 in license fees. Authorities around the world, particularly in Asia, have attempted to rein in the global boom in trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies - a form of digital money created and maintained by its users. The Philippine central bank, which regulates virtual currency exchanges in the country, has not endorsed the use of any cryptocurrency saying it is open to misuse. The economic zone regulator is also looking at putting up a blockchain and financial technology university in the economic zone to provide workers for the companies, Lambino said.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration has been aggressive, but so far it has followed the rules of the game. By Neil Irwin Many events of the last week have had the ominous undertones of a destructive global trade war. There was President Trump‚Äôs seemingly spontaneous announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs, as well as retaliatory threats from close allies, and the president‚Äôs tweets predicting that a trade war would be easy to win.  It has all felt a little too much as if we‚Äôre in the early chapters of a history book about a calamitous event. But there is nothing inevitable about a trade war. In fact, the rebound in the financial markets in the last week suggests that the chances of a complete breakdown in the global trade system remain remote, if a little less remote than a week ago. That‚Äôs because the Trump administration has mostly paired the president‚Äôs bellicose language with signals that it will act within the rules of the global trade game. That is especially true if you follow formal documents issued by the relevant government agencies instead of the president‚Äôs tweets. This approach was evident Wednesday when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, ‚ÄúThere are potential carveouts for Mexico and Canada based on national security and possibly other countries as well,‚Äù regarding the steel and aluminum tariffs announced last week.  This implies the administration is seeking to use the tariffs more as a negotiating chit with two of the nation‚Äôs biggest trading partners. It was also evident in the relative quiet from the just-finished round of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. A rule of thumb is that the less the participants are airing in public, the more productive negotiations are behind the scenes. That‚Äôs not to say that the steel and aluminum tariffs don‚Äôt risk economic and diplomatic damage. They are likely to harm industries that use the metals as an input, like makers of automobiles and aircraft. And by invoking national security grounds as cause for the action, the Trump administration may be giving other countries more license to do the same to protect their favored industries. But for the years ahead, the smart money is on ‚Äúno trade war, but also no trade peace,‚Äù as Terry Haines, managing director and head of political analysis at Evercore ISI, put it. The United States could launch a steady stream of actions against trading partners, especially China, and some of them may even prove costly. But Mr. Haines argues it is unlikely that the administration will escalate things in ways that might launch a 1930s-style cycle of rising tariffs and all-out economic warfare, even as the administration turns its focus to China. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see tit-for-tat actions, but our view of this is that you‚Äôre going to get two countries who understand that it is fundamentally more in their interest to cooperate than compete,‚Äù Mr. Haines said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to figure out ways to cooperate even in the midst of things that sound like they‚Äôre escalating.‚Äù Scholars who have studied trade disputes have found that trade skirmishes can end with more mutually satisfactory arrangements. One key is for countries to retaliate carefully against what they consider to be unfair practices, targeting politically sensitive industries in the country with which they are clashing. It is a safe bet that negotiators in the United States, China and elsewhere are well aware of this. The implication of this view is not that an all-out trade war is impossible, just that some of the loose talk about the idea in the last week ‚Äî including by the president ‚Äî is getting far ahead of the facts. Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at the accounting firm RSM, sketched out what a true trade war would look like. ‚ÄúThe first indicator that a trade war has begun would be the announced intention to withdraw from, or abrogate, current trade treaty arrangements,‚Äù Mr. Brusuelas wrote recently.  He contrasts that with ‚Äútrade spats,‚Äù which take place continually, and tariff actions that are rarer but have been used many times without setting off a major economic dislocation. A recent example was the Obama administration‚Äôs 2009 tariff on Chinese tires, which did coincide with a rebound in domestic tire production (though it was costly relative to the number of jobs created). If the United States ignored rulings of the World Trade Organization, or pulled out of Nafta, it could trigger a series of steps including not just tariffs but other restrictions on international commerce, and perhaps limits on the flow of capital across borders and even the expropriation of foreign-owned assets. He does not see that dark scenario as imminent. ‚ÄúWhile the U.S. rests on the edge of a trade friction spilling over into a period of trading tariffs, it is not yet on the brink of a trade war,‚Äù he said. What should people who are worried of dangerous escalation watch for? An early one will be whom Mr. Trump appoints to succeed Gary Cohn as director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Cohn, a Wall Street veteran who announced his resignation after the tariff plan was announced, was a voice for restraint in trade policy. It‚Äôs an open question whether his successor will be as well. Beyond that, an important question is whether the Trump administration continues along with negotiations and measured, narrowly focused tariffs aimed at specific policy goals ‚Äî or tries to withdraw from or ignore Nafta or the trade agreement with South Korea.  The biggest question of all will be whether the administration will reject the authority of the W.T.O. in the event of an unfavorable ruling, which would undermine a mainstay of global trade governance. Those risks are out there, and it‚Äôs clear that the president‚Äôs personal instincts are to run toward risk rather than away from it. But that doesn‚Äôt mean a trade war is upon us.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Clint Watts Mr. Watts testified on March 30, 2017,¬†at a¬†Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing and presented¬†a statement, ‚ÄúDisinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns.‚Äù Last week, in a sentencing memorandum for the lawyer Alex Van Der Zwaan, the special counsel‚Äôs office noted that Rick Gates and ‚ÄúPerson A‚Äù ‚Äî an unnamed figure who has ties to a ‚ÄúRussian intelligence service and had such ties in 2016‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äúwere directly communicating in September and October 2016.‚Äù What coverage there was of this staggering claim ‚Äî evidence of a direct link between a member of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign and Russian intelligence ‚Äî and the Van Der Zwaan filing was quickly overtaken by controversy over the president‚Äôs relationship with an adult film star. It‚Äôs been a year since I testified to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee on Russian interference in the presidential election of 2016. The revelations from Robert Mueller‚Äôs indictments since then have provided so much clarity on how Russia interfered in our democracy ‚Äî yet Americans seem more confused about the question of possible collusion with Russia. That is, in a way, by design ‚Äî Russia‚Äôs design. Its infiltration and influence on America is difficult to understand, even with vastly more detail about Russia‚Äôs influence efforts. A lot of the focus on the Mueller investigation has fallen on Donald Trump: Did he obstruct the investigation? Was he a ‚ÄúManchurian Candidate‚Äù or just a Russian ally, by ideology or business interests? In my view, as a former F.B.I. special agent who has watched the Kremlin‚Äôs infiltration of America since 2014, the answer may be neither. A standard Russian approach would have been to influence Mr. Trump through surrogates like Mr. Gates and Paul Manafort rather than through direct command through an individual ‚Äî in this case, the candidate and then president. Russian intelligence develops options and pathways over many years; as objectives arise ‚Äî like the election of Mr. Trump ‚Äî they focus and engage all available touch points. The revelation last week about Mr. Gates‚Äôs connection is another piece of evidence to support that view. Russia‚Äôs efforts to influence, known by the Kremlin moniker Active Measures, did not seek a single pathway into the Trump team. Instead, they targeted a wide spectrum of influential Americans to subtly nudge their preferred policy into the mainstream and sideline foreign opponents. Russian intelligence services establish campaign objectives and compromise foreign targets through espionage, but their principal focus is to recruit agents of influence. Typically, the Kremlin deploys layers of surrogates and proxies offering business inducements, information or threatened reprisals that can individually be explained away by coincidence while masking the strings and guiding hands of the Kremlin‚Äôs puppet masters and their objectives. When called upon by the Kremlin, oligarchs, contractors, criminals and spies (current or former) all provide levers for advancing President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs assault on democracies. In Trump and his campaign, Mr. Putin spotted a golden opportunity ‚Äî an easily ingratiated celebrity motivated by fame and fortune, a foreign policy novice surrounded by unscreened opportunists open to manipulation and unaware of Russia‚Äôs long run game of subversion. Mr. Putin has succeeded where his Soviet forefathers failed by leveraging money and cyberspace to subtly infiltrate and influence Americans while maintaining plausible deniability of their efforts. And the Kremlin‚Äôs ground game ‚Äúcut outs‚Äù ‚Äî intermediaries who facilitate communication between agents ‚Äî conducted a more complex game. Each Mueller indictment and investigative lead illuminates more Kremlin influence avenues into President Trump‚Äôs inner circle. Mr. Van Der Zwaan, whose father-in-law is the Russian oligarch German Khan, lied to investigators about his conversations with Mr. Gates, the Trump deputy campaign manager, and a Person A, whom the F.B.I. assessed as a Russian intelligence agent and many believe to be Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate of both Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort, a Trump campaign manager. Evidence of Russia‚Äôs intent to interfere in the election is overwhelming, and documentation of Trump campaign members‚Äô collusion not only exists but is growing. The special counsel‚Äôs investigation into collusion ultimately comes down to two questions. First, did President Trump or any member of his campaign willingly coordinate their actions with Russia? And did President Trump or any member of his campaign knowingly coordinate their action with Russia? Trump campaign members certainly colluded with Russian influence efforts, some willingly, some possibly knowingly. The president denies the Kremlin‚Äôs hand, either still unaware or in denial of being manipulated by Mr. Putin‚Äôs minions. For Mr. Putin, it‚Äôs likely everything he hoped for ‚Äî America riddled with political infighting and mired in investigations, a weakened NATO alliance vulnerable to aggression and a United States president seeking his adoration, obstinate and ignorant of the great caper the Kremlin just orchestrated. The problem for the president is that ignorance is not immunity. The problem for America is that ignorance of Russian interference is vulnerability. Clint Watts (@selectedwisdom) is the Robert A.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Andrew Higgins and Peter Baker MOSCOW ‚Äî Russia sought to move beyond last week‚Äôs diplomatic confrontation with the West on Monday by pressing President Trump for a White House meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin that would undercut the perception that the angry reaction to the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain has left it isolated from the international community. The Kremlin foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said in Moscow that Mr. Trump, in a telephone call with Mr. Putin on March 20, proposed that the two leaders meet at the White House in the near future. Mr. Ushakov made clear that the Russian leader would like to take him up on the suggestion. ‚ÄúThis is a rather positive idea,‚Äù he said. Mr. Trump mentioned to reporters on the day of the phone call that he expected to ‚Äúbe seeing President Putin in the not-too-distant future,‚Äù and the White House confirmed on Monday that it was among ‚Äúa number of potential venues‚Äù discussed. But the phone call came before last week‚Äôs tit-for-tat mass diplomatic expulsions sparked by the nerve agent attack on Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian spy living in Britain. It is not clear whether such a meeting is still viable, and both sides issued vague or even conflicting statements on Monday. Within hours of Mr. Ushakov‚Äôs comment, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, discounted it, saying the president‚Äôs adviser was not correct. In her own statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, confirmed that a White House meeting was discussed but played down the prospect, saying, ‚ÄúWe have nothing further to add at this time.‚Äù The idea of a personal get-together between the two presidents after each of them expelled 60 diplomats and closed consulates underscored the volatile nature of the Russian-American relationship these days. Mr. Trump has remained on friendly terms with Mr. Putin personally even as ties between their countries spiral toward Cold War depths. But a meeting between the two leaders at this point would seem to conflict with the attitude of Mr. Trump‚Äôs incoming foreign policy team, including Mike Pompeo, his nominee for secretary of state, and John R. Bolton, his new national security adviser, both of whom are considered Russia hawks. ‚ÄúI think the Russians are looking for an off-ramp at the moment,‚Äù said Angela Stent, a former national intelligence officer on Russia during President George W. Bush‚Äôs administration and now director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University. ‚ÄúPerhaps they have followed‚Äù news accounts ‚Äúabout divisions over Russia policy and they want to set a possible meeting in motion before Bolton and Pompeo assume their new jobs.‚Äù Sarah E. Mendelson, a former State Department official under President Barack Obama now at Carnegie Mellon University, suggested it may be part of ‚Äúa strategy on the Russians‚Äô part to engage Trump as if he were disconnected from his‚Äù advisers. Just as Mr. Trump engages Mr. Putin as if there were not tension because of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the special counsel investigation into contacts with his campaign, Mr. Putin may simply ignore that as well. ‚ÄúIt all seems to be happening in parallel universes,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúone in which Russia poisons and interferes, and another in which none of this happened.‚Äù Other analysts said the discussion of a possible meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin may be more for domestic consumption in a Russia that sees itself excoriated by the international community after the poisoning of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. ‚ÄúPeople are realizing what a major hit they took,‚Äù said John R. Beyrle, a former American ambassador to Russia. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a way to say, ‚ÄòSee, it‚Äôs not so bad, Putin is still welcome in polite society.‚Äô I was in Moscow last month just before the elections and was struck by how fed up some members of the Russian elite are getting at their perpetual pariah status ‚Äî and this was before Skripal.‚Äù A White House visit would be a significant gesture toward the Russian leader. Mr. Putin has not been to the White House since 2005, when Mr. Bush hosted him there. Other than United Nations sessions, Mr. Putin‚Äôs last visit to the United States for a presidential summit meeting came in 2007 when Mr. Bush and his father hosted him at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Me. Mr. Obama never invited Mr. Putin to the White House during his eight years in office, and the Russian declined an invitation to Camp David in 2012 for a meeting of what was then called the Group of 8. The two did meet in New York in 2015 during a United Nations session. Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin have met in Germany and in Vietnam on the sideline of international summit meetings and currently have no plans to get together before November, when both are expected to attend a Group of 20 gathering in Argentina. Mr. Ushakov said the two sides had not started any preparatory talks for a White House meeting because of the tailspin in relations. He nonetheless voiced a desire that Mr. Trump not drop the idea. ‚ÄúI hope the Americans won‚Äôt abandon their proposal to discuss the possibility of holding the summit,‚Äù he said. Just as Mr. Trump has shown a striking reluctance to criticize Mr. Putin, even when the two countries are ejecting each other‚Äôs diplomats, the Kremlin and the Russian news outlets it controls have often avoided criticizing Mr. Trump directly. Soon after news of a possible White House meeting broke on Monday, a discussion on Rossiya 1, a state-controlled television channel, focused on a host of conspiracy theories to explain why the nerve gas attack in Britain had so disrupted relations between Moscow and Washington. Most revolved around the premise that American interest groups opposed to Mr. Trump‚Äôs desire for rapprochement with Russia had staged the poisoning as a ‚Äúprovocation‚Äù to drive a wedge between Europe and Russia. Particularly popular was the idea that the attack was an attempt to get Europeans to stop importing natural gas from Russia and shift to supplies from the United States. None of the participants in the discussion faulted Mr. Trump for the sharp deterioration in relations. In a debate on state-controlled television on Sunday evening, a weekly shout-fest often dedicated to screaming about American perfidy, Sergey Mikheev, one of the participants, put forward what seems to be the consensus view of Russia‚Äôs establishment: Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin are both eager to meet as soon as possible so they can stabilize relations but are prevented from doing so by opposition in the United States. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not because Putin isn‚Äôt ready, and not because Trump doesn‚Äôt want to meet Putin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo such thing at all. Trump said that he is, in fact, even ready to meet Kim Jong-un. It is internal problems that prevent Trump from meeting anyone.‚Äù America‚Äôs ‚Äúinternal political crisis,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúprevents Trump from solving this problem. Current domestic political situation in the U.S. is such that Trump can‚Äôt afford meeting Putin.‚Äù Andrew Higgins reported from Moscow, and Peter Baker from Washington.

Business,"Advertisement By KEITH BRADSHER and ALAN RAPPEPORTMARCH 26, 2018  BEIJING ‚Äî China has struck a hard stance on the issue at the root of the looming trade fight between Beijing and Washington: China‚Äôs government-led drive, which Washington describes as breaking international rules, to build the cutting-edge industries of the future. Chinese officials in recent days have been defending the government‚Äôs ambitious plan, known as Made in China 2025, to create globally competitive players in industries like advanced microchips, driverless cars and robotics. While Beijing has signaled a willingness to compromise on other matters, the intractable standoff over its core industrial policy could prolong a trade fight that has already shaken markets and led to concerns about a full-blown trade war. ‚ÄúWe are three years into the implementation of Made in China 2025, and we will keep going,‚Äù Miao Wei, China‚Äôs minister of industry and information technology, said on Monday, the last day of a three-day economic policy forum in the Chinese capital. The Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on imports involving many of the industries being developed under the Made in China 2025 program. Administration officials strongly object to the program‚Äôs goal of having Chinese companies dominate these advanced industries, particularly in the Chinese market. Advertisement Washington has also protested that companies in the targeted industries have been offered loans at low interest rates by state-controlled Chinese banks. The White House argues that will result in global capacity gluts that could drive down prices and destroy the viability of tech companies in the West, as well as in countries, like Japan and South Korea, that are allied with the United States. Advertisement ‚ÄúChina has engaged for a very long time in the theft of our intellectual property as well as practices like forced technology transfer,‚Äù Peter Navarro, President Trump‚Äôs trade adviser, said on CNBC on Monday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hopeful that China will basically work with us to address some of these practices.‚Äù Mr. Navarro on Monday tried to calm financial markets, which were rattled last week by the prospect of a trade war. He emphasized that ‚Äúgrowth and stability‚Äù were the aim of Mr. Trump‚Äôs policy goal of ensuring that trade with the United States is fair and reciprocal. Investors‚Äô fears of a trade war seemed to subside some on Monday. The Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500-stock index climbed 2.7 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite jumped 3.3 percent. Whether an agreement that forestalls a protracted economic conflict can be reached remains unclear. The two nations, whose markets are highly integrated, have engaged in discussions for years with little to show as a result. Talks between the United States and China stalled last summer, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue between two countries has produced little progress. The Trump administration has largely shunned the highly structured discussions of past administrations, which were used to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. The White House now views those channels as producing largely hollow promises by the Chinese and has shifted toward engaging directly with senior-level Chinese counterparts. On Saturday, just two days after the administration announced tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, called Liu He, China‚Äôs economic czar, to congratulate him on his new role of vice premier. The two discussed the trade tensions, including reducing tariffs on American cars and opening up China‚Äôs financial services sector to American firms. ‚ÄúThey also discussed the trade deficit between our two countries and committed to continuing the dialogue to find a mutually agreeable way to reduce it,‚Äù a Treasury spokeswoman said. Advertisement China‚Äôs official news agency, Xinhua, characterized the call between Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Liu as confrontational, with Mr. Liu warning Mr. Mnuchin that America‚Äôs trade actions against China were straining economic ties between the countries. Chinese leaders contend that their country‚Äôs economy is still developing. They openly reject Mr. Trump‚Äôs call for reciprocity in trade relations. They have instead offered concessions like raising  caps on foreign investors‚Äô stakes in Chinese financial institutions, and proposed eliminating import tariffs in narrow categories like drugs to treat cancer. Beijing says that opening up some services sectors would improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy as well as make money for foreign companies. Improving health care, particularly for the aging, has also become a national priority. But Chinese officials argue that their country is still dangerously reliant on smokestack industries of the past, like steel,  aluminum and cheap manufacturing. The average Chinese household lives on a quarter of the income that American and Western European households do, and standards of living remain very low in rural parts of the country, and across central and western China.

Wang Shouwen, China‚Äôs vice minister of commerce, and Pascal Lamy, a former director general of the World Trade Organization, squared off at the Beijing forum over precisely that issue. Mr. Wang insisted that China had made considerable strides in opening up its health, agriculture and shipping sectors to international competition. He noted that the United States and the European Union had higher tariffs than China on some imports of shirts and dairy products. He argued that China meets its W.T.O. obligations; the W.T.O. has long allowed developing countries to have higher tariffs to protect certain industries from international competition. Mr. Lamy, a longtime critic of protectionism and government intervention, dismissed those arguments. China ‚Äî which has the world‚Äôs second-largest economy, after the United States, and is the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer by far, of everything from steel and cement to laptop computers ‚Äî had made too much progress to be lumped in with poor countries, he said. ‚ÄúPretending it is like India, or like Senegal, or like Botswana is pushing the envelope too far,‚Äù Mr. Lamy said. He added that China still had to do more to ‚Äúensure a level playing field between Chinese producers and foreign producers, whether they produce inside China or outside of China.‚Äù On crucial issues, China and the United States appear to be talking past each other, not even agreeing on what is being debated. Advertisement Take semiconductors, for example: China is a major customer for microchips, which are used to power computers, smartphones and an ever-widening array of other electronics. Chips from the United States account for just 4 percent of China‚Äôs $260 billion in annual chip imports. While Chinese trade officials have been willing to discuss buying more chips from factories in the United States, that could take market share from Japan and South Korea. Washington has resisted that solution. American officials say the problem is that China‚Äôs national, provincial and municipal governments are working with state-owned banks to rush the construction of factories, particularly to make memory chips. The new factories often rely on technology that foreign companies have had to transfer as a condition of competing in the Chinese market, according to the United States. Global trade rules ban mandatory technology transfers. Numerous factories are nearing completion, which will unleash an avalanche of additional output. China contends that it has assisted the sector partly to upgrade its economy and partly because the factories will mainly be supplying its domestic market. But since factories in China are the world‚Äôs main assemblers of electronics, the country‚Äôs drive for self-sufficiency in microchips could pose a threat to chip producers in the rest of the world. For now, China seems to be pinning its hopes on heavy lobbying in Washington by Wall Street, traditionally Beijing‚Äôs most reliable ally in bilateral disputes. China‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in a variety of American financial institutions. Estimates of Chinese outbound investment over the next decade run as high as $2.5 trillion, a rich source of advisory fees in the United States. Mr. Wang said on Sunday that China might go beyond its earlier offer to raise caps on foreign ownership in Chinese financial institutions. ‚ÄúIt is even possible we will remove those caps altogether‚Äù in some categories, he said. But he also made clear that China would not be intimidated if its offers are not enough to satisfy the Trump administration, which has focused on reviving American manufacturing. ‚ÄúIf China‚Äôs interests are impaired,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe will have to take measures.‚Äù Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Maya Salam and Heather Casey Here are the week‚Äôs top stories, and a look ahead. 1. The Justice Department is charging forward with President Trump‚Äôs agenda, even as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, above, is often the subject of his criticism. Two big announcements ‚Äî on affirmative action and leak investigations ‚Äî grabbed the nation‚Äôs attention last week. The department intends to investigate whether universities discriminate against white applicants. It may also review a private lawsuit against Harvard that alleges diversity initiatives have in effect restricted Asian-American admissions. We examined how strategies in college admissions have evolved. Regarding leaks, Mr. Sessions vowed to bring criminal charges against those who give classified information to the news media. ____ 2. President Trump is backing a bill that would slash the number of legal immigrants coming to the United States by 41 percent in its first year. The proposal would place skills, education and language ability above family ties, and would be the most far-reaching change to legal immigration in decades. The administration‚Äôs stance has helped drive so many asylum seekers to Canada that authorities there opened a temporary welcome center in Montreal‚Äôs 56,000-seat Olympic Stadium, above. ____ 3. Investigators working for the special prosecutor Robert Mueller have asked the administration to hand over documents on Michael Flynn, above, the first such request. They are looking into whether Mr. Flynn, the former national security adviser, was secretly paid by Turkey during the presidential campaign. John Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, is on a mission to impose military discipline on the faction-ridden White House.

Here‚Äôs how writers on the right and left are thinking about the administrative state. ____ 5. The U.S. economy gave President Trump a significant bright spot last week. The stock market hit record highs, foreign corporations announced new American plants, and the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low. ____ 6. Congress forced President Trump to sign legislation that imposed sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election, heightening already tense relations with Moscow. Lawmakers passed it with bipartisan, veto-proof majorities. The measure also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. On Friday, Mr. Trump headed to New Jersey for a 17-day working vacation while the White House undergoes a $3.4 million renovation. President Vladimir Putin, above, also took a vacation.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Jina Moore NAIROBI, Kenya ‚Äî More than 40 African countries signed a free trade pact on Wednesday that the nations hope will fulfill a long-held dream of greater economic integration on the continent. But among the holdouts are two of Africa‚Äôs biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, raising concerns about whether the agreement can make good on its promises. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which has been in the works for two years, aims to unite participating countires into a single trading market that would be one of the largest free trade zones in the world since the World Trade Organization was created in 1995. Of Africa‚Äôs 55 countries, 44 signed the pact. ‚ÄúAmongst African states in general, there has long been a hankering for a trade agreement that transcends national boundaries,‚Äù said John Campbell, a senior fellow and Africa expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ‚ÄúIn Africa more than any other part of the world, national boundaries are seen as artificial, essentially as a colonial imposition.‚Äù ‚ÄúMoving from an aspiration to the actual specific words on a page, of course, becomes very much more complicated,‚Äù he added. Of the 11 holdouts, Nigeria and South Africa represent $700 billion ‚Äî or one-third ‚Äî of the $2.1 trillion in gross domestic product across all 55 African countries. The two countries are also home to 242 million people, or 20 percent of Africa‚Äôs population of 1.2 billion. ‚ÄúIt will have a huge effect on the agreement if they remain on the outside,‚Äù said Joshua Meservey, a senior policy analyst on Africa and the Middle East at the Heritage Foundation. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it would cripple the agreement, but it will badly damage it.‚Äù Nigeria, the continent‚Äôs largest economy, was the most notable drop-out. Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, abruptly canceled his trip to Kigali, Rwanda, where the agreement was signed. Though his cabinet had said the agreement would create jobs and foster growth, officials said more time was needed for consultation. The Nigeria Labour Congress, the organized labor union, opposed the deal, saying it had not been consulted. According to a local newspaper, The Daily Trust, the organization called the deal a ‚Äúradioactive neoliberal policy initiative‚Äù that it said would open Nigeria to ‚Äúunbridled foreign interference never before witnessed in the history of the country.‚Äù Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president of Nigeria and an elder statesman on the continent, called the Buhari administration‚Äôs reluctance ‚Äúcriminal,‚Äù according to KTPress, a Rwandan news outlet. ‚ÄúI am surprised that any African leader at this time would be doubting or debating the benefits of what is going to be signed here and fail to show up,‚Äù he said. Albert Muchanga, the commissioner for trade and industry at the African Union Commission, which oversaw the negotiations, said the 11 holdout countries wanted to hold more consultations at home, and may join later. ‚ÄúThey did not say they are turning their backs on the agreement, no,‚Äù he said by telephone from Kigali. The agreement will come into force after 22 countries ratify it in their national parliaments, which Mr. Muchanga said he expected would happen within the year. Thereafter, countries will be added as they ratify, he said. Mr. Meservey, the Heritage Foundation analyst, said non-signatory countries may demand exceptions to the general agreement even as the process goes forward. ‚ÄúMy concern about countries holding out is that they are looking for leverage over the final agreement in order to protect their preferred industries,‚Äù he said, pointing out that European Union free trade pacts have been plagued by similar problems. The pact includes a commitment to gradually phase out taxes on imports from other African nations. Mr. Muchanga said the commision expected the move would bolster small- and medium-sized businesses, better enabling them to contribute to large-scale supply chains. Intra-African exports now face taxes of 6 percent on average, which African Union officials said makes it more expensive to export goods within the continent than to outside countries. Only 16 percent of Africa‚Äôs trade takes place between countries on the continent, according to the union. The commision expects that to jump to more than 50 percent if all 55 nations sign on to the pact. Mr. Muchanga said the new agreement also aimed to create jobs and broader economic diversification, in particular by overcoming the continent‚Äôs reliance on exporting resources like minerals and oil, and by reducing non-tariff business hurdles, like onerous regulation. He also said yearly monitoring and evaluation will yield better results for this agreement than for its regional predecessors. The Economic Community of West African States and the East African Community both have ‚Äúhad a real problem implementing what are very solid agreements,‚Äù Mr. Meservey said. Mr. Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations said regional cooperation has generally worked better on security issues than on economic ones ‚Äî for the same reason that the continent‚Äôs key players have, for the moment, ‚Äúhit pause‚Äù on the agreement. ‚ÄúEconomic issues hit right in the pocketbook,‚Äù he said.

Politics,"Advertisement By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTMAY 3, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump‚Äôs lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has contradicted Mr. Trump‚Äôs rationale for firing James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, saying he was dismissed because he would not say publicly what he had told the president privately: that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny in the Russia investigation at the time. ‚ÄúHe fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn‚Äôt a target of the investigation,‚Äù Mr. Giuliani said in an interview late Wednesday with Sean Hannity of Fox News. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs entitled to that.‚Äù Mr. Giuliani‚Äôs assertion contradicted the myriad explanations that the president and his aides have given for the firing, and was the first public acknowledgment by a Trump adviser for what Mr. Comey has maintained: that he was fired for his handling of the Russia investigation. At the time of Mr. Comey‚Äôs dismissal last May, both Mr. Trump and his aides cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server and his decision to say publicly during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, would not be charged with a crime. Advertisement Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said that Mr. Comey‚Äôs handling of the Clinton investigation ‚Äúwas a total disgrace.‚Äù Later in the interview, Mr. Giuliani added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Hillary. I know you‚Äôre very disappointed you didn‚Äôt win. But you‚Äôre a criminal. Equal justice would mean you should go to jail. I do not know why the Justice Department is not investigating her.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Comey said in July 2016 that Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs handling of classified information was ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù but fell short of criminal behavior and that he was not recommending charges. Mr. Giuliani‚Äôs comments about Mr. Comey were overshadowed by his disclosure that Mr. Trump reimbursed his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for hush money paid before the election to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani‚Äôs comments directly contradicted Mr. Trump, who had said he had no knowledge of the payments.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Mr. Giuliani‚Äôs assertion that Mr. Comey was fired over the Russia inquiry did line up with accounts from both Mr. Comey and White House officials who have been interviewed by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose appointment was prompted in part by the abrupt firing of Mr. Comey. Those people said that Mr. Trump became increasingly frustrated in the spring of 2017 with Mr. Comey‚Äôs reluctance to say publicly that the president was not under investigation. Mr. Comey testified to Congress that during calls to him that spring, the president asked him to get out word that he was not being investigated. Mr. Comey responded ‚Äî and memorialized his answer later in memos ‚Äî that such a matter needed to be considered through proper channels between the White House and the Justice Department, rather than by the two of them. Mr. Comey was reluctant at the time to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in case he were to be investigated later. Mr. Comey‚Äôs top lawyer at the F.B.I. had argued that as the bureau‚Äôs inquiry into links between Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign and Russia progressed, investigators were almost certainly going to examine Mr. Trump‚Äôs conduct. Since then, the special counsel has begun examining Mr. Trump‚Äôs actions, including his firing of Mr. Comey, and whether they constitute an effort to obstruct the investigation itself. On Thursday, Mr. Comey criticized Mr. Giuliani‚Äôs description of F.B.I. agents who raided Mr. Cohen‚Äôs office and home as ‚Äústorm troopers,‚Äù though he did not address his firing.              I know the New York FBI. There are no ‚Äústormtroopers‚Äù there; just a group of people devoted to the rule of law and the truth.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board The phalanx of intelligence chiefs who testified on Capitol Hill delivered a chilling message: Not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 election, it is already meddling in the 2018 election by using a digital strategy to exacerbate the country‚Äôs political and social divisions. No one knows more about the threats to the United States than these six officials, so when they all agree, it would be derelict to ignore their concerns. Yet President Trump continues to refuse to even acknowledge the malevolent Russian role. It‚Äôs particularly striking that four of the men who gave this warning to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday ‚Äî the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo; the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats; the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray; and the Defense Intelligence Agency director, Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley ‚Äî were all appointed by Mr. Trump. They testified that the president has never asked them to take measures to combat Russian interference and protect democratic processes. Mr. Trump isn‚Äôt completely oblivious about Russia, of course. He fired Mr. Wray‚Äôs predecessor, James Comey, to derail the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation of possible Trump campaign involvement with the election hacking, and reportedly asked Mr. Coats and Mr. Pompeo to help end the investigation of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Mr. Flynn‚Äôs contacts with Russians. With the midterm elections only nine months away, the federal government is taking some defensive measures. It is trying to get at least one election official in each state a security clearance to make them aware of threats, and is providing states with enhanced online security to ensure that Americans‚Äô votes will not be manipulated. Nevertheless, absent Mr. Trump‚Äôs commitment, there can be no robust mobilization to take all measures needed to confront an insidious problem that strikes at the heart of the democratic system. These would include a comprehensive and well-funded plan for protecting critical infrastructure, countering cyberattacks and mitigating propaganda. The president should not only be strengthening electoral defenses, but also pushing back against Russia, instead of ignoring a law Congress adopted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions for election meddling and aggression against Ukraine. The list of potential activities meriting sanctions covers weapons deals, human rights abuses and Russian cyberattacks against the United States and other democracies. Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured Congress on Wednesday that sanctions ‚Äúare coming,‚Äù there‚Äôs little reason to believe him. The State Department recently argued that it didn‚Äôt impose sanctions against companies doing weapons deals with Russia because the threat of sanctions was enough to deter some of those deals. But there is no excuse for not acting against Russia for cyberattacks ‚Äî Mr. Trump‚Äôs own intelligence chiefs say such activity has increased, not diminished. So why is Mr. Trump still ignoring such conclusions? Some have said he is giving Russia a green light to tamper with the 2018 elections. That would have once been an absurd suggestion. It can no longer be dismissed out of hand. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Michael Doran Mr. Doran was a senior director at the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration. The United States will be making an exit from Syria ‚Äúvery soon,‚Äù President Trump said late last month in Ohio. ‚ÄúLet the other people take care of it now.‚Äù In making this announcement, the president ignored a cardinal principle of an author he holds in very high regard: himself. According to ‚ÄúThe Art of the Deal,‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs 1987 best-selling guide to business strategy, success in negotiations requires developing leverage. The crux of the matter is appearing unflappable while making the other guy sweat. ‚ÄúThe worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it,‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote. ‚ÄúThat makes the other guy smell blood, and then you‚Äôre dead.‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs Syria announcement fostered the impression of a president desperate to get out of the Middle East. It also violated another oft-repeated Trumpian principle: never, ever telegraph your military moves. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is,‚Äù Mr. Trump said during the 2016 presidential campaign. The announcement generated considerable unease in the foreign policy establishment. Senator John McCain, among others, claimed that Mr. Trump‚Äôs call for a withdrawal emboldened Bashar al-Assad, convincing him he could launch a chemical weapons attack a mere 10 days later. The claim is speculative, but not outrageous. Mr. Assad has a strong imperative to clear insurgents from eastern Ghouta, the stronghold of the most formidable Damascus-based militia. Believing that the United States was headed for the exits may have made him even more willing to hold back nothing. Mr. Trump probably assumed that his announcement would spur America‚Äôs allies like Israel, and, especially, Saudi Arabia to step up. That tactic is dangerous. If allies conclude that an American departure is inevitable, they will hedge their bets. Some will lie low. Others will make a beeline to Vladimir Putin. Russia, they know, will never quit Syria. Washington, someone once said, might be indispensable, but Moscow is immovable. After the departure of American troops, Mr. Putin‚Äôs first goal will be to sever the bonds that tie Turkey to NATO. His preferred method will be to supplant the United States as the primary interlocutor between the Syrian Kurds and the Turks. Deprived of direct American support, the Kurds will inevitably turn to Moscow, the sole available source of protection from Turkey. Mr. Putin will welcome them with open arms to gain leverage ‚Äî there‚Äôs that word again ‚Äî over Ankara. Moscow will demand from Ankara that it distance itself from the West or face a Russian policy supportive of a maximalist Kurdish agenda. Many in Washington have adopted a blas√© attitude about this prospect. They argue that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is lost to the West. This is a monumental failure of the imagination. The damage that a truly hostile Turkey can do is far worse than anything we have seen so far. And the key to managing relations with Turkey is maintaining primacy in the Turkish-Kurdish arena ‚Äî a status that will disappear the moment American troops leave Syria. A precipitous departure will also cede leverage to Iran at the very moment when United States-Iranian conflict is set to escalate. On May 12, Mr. Trump may well decide to reimpose nuclear sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Restructuring the nuclear deal to American specifications requires convincing Iran‚Äôs supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, that America is resolute in its determination to pare down the Iranian nuclear program. Retreating from Syria will foster the opposite impression. Mr. Trump should be thinking instead of exploiting Iranian weaknesses. Here the Israelis are the key. Their attack on Monday on an Iranian base in the Syrian desert is striking not just for the military and intelligence capabilities it demonstrated but also for the defiance of Mr. Putin. Boldness and ability of this magnitude in an ally is a four-star asset that Mr. Trump‚Äôs Mideast policy has so far failed to exploit. Imagine if Washington and Jerusalem were to develop a joint military plan designed to contain and degrade Iranian forces in Syria. Even a limited American military commitment to a coordinated United States-Israeli strategy would immediately change the balance of power on the ground. It would most likely engender more diplomatic cooperation from Mr. Putin while sending a powerful message to Tehran about the necessity of respecting American demands regarding its nuclear program. Going forward, Mr. Trump should stick to his campaign promise and keep mum about his plans. Meantime, he should reconsider his intention to withdraw. As it is, the United States has a small footprint in Syria ‚Äî an estimated 2,000 troops. The right strategy could reduce those numbers further while gaining even more of that precious commodity over Iran and Russia: leverage.

Business,"Advertisement By JOHN SCHWARTZAPRIL 13, 2018  I am going to start a trade war! If you‚Äôre like me, you used to think trade wars belonged in the dustbin of history that you learned about in high school and then forgot ‚Äî something having to do with Hawley-Smoot, or Smoot-Hawley. Whatever. We don‚Äôt fight trade wars any more, I thought. Instead, we make trade deals to keep goods flowing around the world. Boy, was I ever wrong. Apparently, we‚Äôve been doing trade wrong for years. That‚Äôs what the president of the United States says, and if you can‚Äôt trust the president, then what‚Äôs your problem? He‚Äôs been talking up trade wars enthusiastically lately, tweeting about how the United States is ‚Äúlosing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt actually true, but you have to admire the boldness. And, he tells us, ‚Äútrade wars are good, and easy to win.‚Äù Advertisement The president imposed stiff tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. China fought back with tariffs as high as 25 percent on 128 products from the United States, including pork, wine and seamless steel pipes, and followed up with even more proposed tariffs on $50 billion in goods that included exports like soybeans and cars. Which will make it harder on our farmers and manufacturers and steel producers to sell their products, while making China‚Äôs imports more expensive for us consumers. From there, things have gotten much more confusing. Advertisement See? Fun! Who doesn‚Äôt like wars that are good and easy to win? I want in on the fun! Therefore, my fellow Americans, I am boldly declaring my own war. After all, I seem to have a deficit with every one of my trading partners. A quick look at my receipts from ShopRite and Whole Foods shows that they have been taking advantage of me for years! And don‚Äôt get me started on Apple. I spend and spend, and do they send me any money in return? They do not. It‚Äôs abusive! For instructions in how to conduct my personal war, I turned, once again, to the commander in chief. ‚ÄúExample, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don‚Äôt trade anymore ‚Äî we win big. It‚Äôs easy!‚Äù O.K., then! It turns out that the trade deficit with Mexico is actually more like $63 billion, but what‚Äôs a 59 percent error among friends? Like the president, I did not have the honor of serving in our armed forces. No problem. This might be my chance to put on a uniform, maybe one with lots of shiny medals and ribbons to commemorate the seamless steel pipe skirmishes I‚Äôve been involved in. Or maybe I could do what the young people do ‚Äî some kind of cosplay that lets me suit up as a Viking, or a ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù storm trooper, or even the rampaging DC Comics character Harley Quinn, girding my loins for economic battle. The problem was that I don‚Äôt know enough about economics to understand what exactly I‚Äôm supposed to do. My mind must be insufficiently deep or subtle to understand these issues, I decided. And so I called a couple of experts, actual economists. First I called Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration. He told me that my personal trade deficit is not as bad as I think it is. ‚ÄúI have a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars trade deficit with P.F. Chang‚Äôs every year, but I‚Äôm a very happy loser,‚Äù he said. Advertisement The problem with trying to engage in a personal trade war, he explained, is that individuals don‚Äôt often produce things that are easy to put a value on and barter. ‚ÄúI give lectures in economics,‚Äù he said, so ‚ÄúI need to find those suckers who are willing to take them so I can eat.‚Äù As for me, he said, I have only one product ‚Äî basically, paragraphs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in worse shape than I am! You should be afraid,‚Äù he said.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Then the conversation began to get uncomfortable. He said that if I were to try to impose a tariff, this interview we were conducting would cost him money because ‚Äî bear with me ‚Äî he would essentially be importing me. I liked that part, until he added that if I went down that route, there would be consequences: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be the last interview I ever do,‚Äù he said. That, he said, is the lesson of trade wars: ‚ÄúTrade stops, and things that used to benefit both of us go away.‚Äù That sounds like the opposite of good and easy to win. I decided to check in with an economist from the Democratic side of the aisle, Austan Goolsbee, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration. I told him about my idea. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a crazy idea,‚Äù he said, helpfully. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to declare a trade war on the grocery store and I‚Äôm going to be better off.‚Äô The thing that you‚Äôve forgotten is that you get a lot of food there.‚Äù It was as Mr. Holtz-Eakin had told me: While businesspeople often see the world in terms of winners and losers, trade policy is about trying to find ways to let a swelling economic tide raise all boats. ‚ÄúTrade deals are about setting the ground rules so other people can get what they want,‚Äù Mr. Goolsbee said. When you stop them all from getting what they want, he said, you‚Äôve ‚Äúgot the game wrong.‚Äù I had to admit that the two economists had a point. I may feel that Whole Foods has, in fact, gotten ‚Äúcute‚Äù by charging so much for wild-caught gulf shrimp and those really amazing rotisserie chickens. But if I don‚Äôt trade with Whole Foods any more, will that really let me ‚Äúwin big‚Äù? Advertisement I really like those shrimp on the grill; they‚Äôre my big weekend splurge. And if I stop spending money in grocery stores altogether, well, what will I eat? Mr. Goolsbee said I was getting the idea: ‚ÄúBuilding walls to trade, that doesn‚Äôt make you rich. That makes you poor.‚Äù And, apparently, shrimpless. Zero sum ‚Äî the idea that there have to be winners and losers ‚Äî ‚Äúis fundamentally the wrong way to think about trade, and doesn‚Äôt make any sense,‚Äù he said. Mr. Goolsbee added that, ‚Äúsadly, it seems that the White House is espousing exactly that view.‚Äù So he‚Äôs saying that I‚Äôm crazy, and I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm not alone. Which is comforting, but still not great. My trade war might have to wait. Which is really too bad, because I‚Äôve already bought the Harley Quinn outfit.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nellie Bowles SAN JUAN, P.R. ‚Äî They call what they are building Puertopia. But then someone told them, apparently in all seriousness, that it translates to ‚Äúeternal boy playground‚Äù in Latin. So they are changing the name: They will call it Sol. Dozens of entrepreneurs, made newly wealthy by blockchain and cryptocurrencies, are heading en masse to Puerto Rico this winter. They are selling their homes and cars in California and establishing residency on the Caribbean island in hopes of avoiding what they see as onerous state and federal taxes on their growing fortunes, some of which now reach into the billions of dollars. And these men ‚Äî because they are almost exclusively men ‚Äî have a plan for what to do with the wealth: They want to build a crypto utopia, a new city where the money is virtual and the contracts are all public, to show the rest of the world what a crypto future could look like. Blockchain, a digital ledger that forms the basis of virtual currencies, has the potential to reinvent society ‚Äî and the Puertopians want to prove it. For more than a year, the entrepreneurs had been searching for the best location. After Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico‚Äôs infrastructure in September and the price of cryptocurrencies began to soar, they saw an opportunity and felt a sense of urgency. So this crypto community flocked here to create its paradise. Now the investors are spending their days hunting for property where they could have their own airports and docks. They are taking over hotels and a museum in the capital‚Äôs historic section, called Old San Juan. They say they are close to getting the local government to allow them to have the first cryptocurrency bank. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happened here is a perfect storm,‚Äù said Halsey Minor, the founder of the news site CNET, who is moving his new blockchain company ‚Äî called Videocoin ‚Äî from the Cayman Islands to Puerto Rico this winter. Referring to Hurricane Maria and the investment interest that has followed, he added, ‚ÄúWhile it was really bad for the people of Puerto Rico, in the long term it‚Äôs a godsend if people look past that.‚Äù Puerto Rico offers an unparalleled tax incentive: no federal personal income taxes, no capital gains tax and favorable business taxes ‚Äî all without having to renounce your American citizenship. For now, the local government seems receptive toward the crypto utopians; the governor will speak at their blockchain summit conference, called Puerto Crypto, in March. The territory‚Äôs go-to blockchain tax lawyer is Giovanni Mendez, 30. He expected the tax expatriates to disappear after Hurricane Maria, but the population has instead boomed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs increased monumentally,‚Äù said Mr. Mendez, who has about two dozen crypto clients. ‚ÄúAnd they all came together.‚Äù The movement is alarming an earlier generation of Puerto Rico tax expats like the hedge fund manager Robb Rill, who runs a social group for those taking advantage of the tax incentives. ‚ÄúThey call me up saying they‚Äôre going to buy 250,000 acres so they can incorporate their own city, literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world,‚Äù said Mr. Rill, who moved to the island in 2013. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt engage in that.‚Äù The newcomers are still debating the exact shape that Puertopia should take. Some think they need to make a city; others think it‚Äôs enough to move into Old San Juan. Puertopians said, however, that they hoped to move very fast. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never seen an industry catalyze a place like you‚Äôre going to see here,‚Äù Mr. Minor said. Until the Puertopians find land, they have descended on the Monastery, a 20,000-square-foot hotel they rented as their base and that was largely unscathed by the hurricane. Matt Clemenson and Stephen Morris were drinking beer on the Monastery‚Äôs roof one recent evening. Mr. Clemenson had an easygoing affect and wore two-tone aviators; Mr. Morris, a loquacious British man, was in cargo shorts and lace-up steel-toed combat boots, with a smartphone on a necklace. They wanted to make two things clear: They chose Puerto Rico because of the hurricane, and they come in peace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only when everything‚Äôs been swept away that you can make a case for rebuilding from the ground up,‚Äù Mr. Morris, 53, said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre benevolent capitalists, building a benevolent economy,‚Äù said Mr. Clemenson, 34, a co-founder of Lottery.com, which is using the blockchain in lotteries. ‚ÄúPuerto Rico has been this hidden gem, this enchanted island that‚Äôs been consistently overlooked and mistreated. Maybe 500 years later we can make it right.‚Äù Other Puertopians arrived on the roof as a pack, just back from a full-day property-hunting bus tour. From the middle, Brock Pierce, 37, the leader of the Puertopia movement, emerged wearing drop crotch capri pants, a black vest that almost hit his knees and a large black felt hat. He and others had arrived on the island in early December. ‚ÄúCompassion, respect, financial transparency,‚Äù Mr. Pierce said when asked what was guiding them here. Mr. Pierce, the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, is a major figure in the crypto boom. He co-founded a blockchain-for-business start-up, Block.One, which has sold around $200 million of a custom virtual currency, EOS, in a so-called initial coin offering. The value of all the outstanding EOS tokens is around $6.5 billion. A former child actor, Mr. Pierce got into digital money early as a professional gamer, mining and trading gold in the video game World of Warcraft, an effort funded partly by Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser. Mr. Pierce is a controversial figure ‚Äî he has previously been sued for fraud, among other matters. Downstairs, in the Monastery penthouse, a dozen or so other expats were hanging out. The water was out that night, so the toilets and faucets were dry. Mr. Minor lounged on an alcove chaise. ‚ÄúThe U.S. doesn‚Äôt want us. It‚Äôs trying to choke off this economy,‚Äù Mr. Minor said, referring to the difficulties that crypto investors have with American banks. ‚ÄúThere needs to be a place where people are free to invent.‚Äù Mr. Pierce paced the room with his hands in fists. A few times a day, he played a video for the group on his phone and a portable speaker: Charlie Chaplin‚Äôs 1940 ‚ÄúThe Great Dictator,‚Äù in which Chaplin parodies Hitler rallying his forces. He finds inspiration in lines like ‚ÄúMore than machinery, we need humanity.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried people are going to misinterpret our actions,‚Äù Mr. Pierce said. ‚ÄúThat we‚Äôre just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes.‚Äù He said he was aiming to create a charitable token called ONE with $1 billion of his own money. ‚ÄúIf you take the MY out of money, you‚Äôre left with ONE,‚Äù Mr. Pierce said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tuned in to a higher calling,‚Äù said Kai Nygard, scion of the Canadian clothing company Nygard and a crypto investor. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs beyond money.‚Äù The force of Mr. Pierce‚Äôs personality and his spiritual presence are important to the group, whose members are otherwise largely agnostic. Mr. Pierce regularly performs rituals. Earlier that day while scoping out property, they had stopped at a historic Ceiba tree, known as the Tree of Life. ‚ÄúBrock nestled into the bosom of it and was there for 10 minutes,‚Äù Mr. Nygard said. Mr. Pierce walked around the tree and said prayers for Puertopia, holding a rusted wrench he had picked up in the territory. He kissed an old man‚Äôs feet. He blessed a crystal in the water, as they all watched. He played the Chaplin speech to everyone and to the tree, Mr. Nygard said. That wrench is now in the penthouse, heavy and greasy. Later on, at a dinner in a nearby restaurant, the group ordered platters of octopus arms, fried cheese, ceviche and rum cocktails. They began debating whether to buy Puerto Rico‚Äôs Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which measures 9,000 acres and has two deepwater ports and an adjacent airport. The only hitch: It‚Äôs a Superfund cleanup site. Mr. Pierce had fallen asleep by then, his hat tilted down and arms crossed. He gets two hours of sleep many nights, often on a firm grounding mat to stay in contact with the earth‚Äôs electric energy. Josh Boles, a tall, athletic man who is another crypto expat, picked him up, and the group headed back to the Monastery. They walked past a big pink building in an old town square, the start of their vision for Puertopia‚Äôs downtown. Once a children‚Äôs museum, they plan on making it a crypto clubhouse and outreach center that will have the mission ‚Äúto bring together Puerto Ricans with Puertopians.‚Äù Workdays are casual in Puertopia. One morning, Bryan Larkin, 39, and Reeve Collins, 42, were working at another old hotel, the Condado Vanderbilt, where they had their laptops on a pool bar with frozen pi√±a coladas on tap. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to make this crypto land,‚Äù Mr. Larkin said. Mr. Larkin has mined about $2 billion in Bitcoin and is the chief technology officer of Blockchain Industries, a publicly traded company based in Puerto Rico. Mr. Collins, an internet veteran, had raised more than $20 million from an initial coin offering for BlockV, his app store for the blockchain, whose outstanding tokens are worth about $125 million. He had also co-founded Tether, which backs cryptocurrency tied to the value of a dollar and whose outstanding tokens are worth about $2.1 billion, though the company has generated enormous controversy in the virtual currency world. ‚ÄúSo, no. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay taxes,‚Äù Mr. Collins said. ‚ÄúThis is the first time in human history anyone other than kings or governments or gods can create their own money.‚Äù He had moved from Santa Monica, Calif., with just a few bags and was now starting a local cryptocurrency incubator called Vatom Factory. ‚ÄúWhen Brock said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre moving to Puerto Rico for the taxes and to create this new town,‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm in,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Collins said. ‚ÄúSight unseen.‚Äù They soon went back to work, checking out Coinmarketcap.com, a site that shows the price of cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúOur market cap‚Äôs gone up $100 million in a week,‚Äù Mr. Collins said. ‚ÄúCongrats, man,‚Äù Mr. Larkin said. All across San Juan, many locals are trying to figure out what to do with the crypto arrivals. Some are open to the new wave as a welcome infusion of investment and ideas. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre open for crypto business,‚Äù said Erika Medina-Vecchini, the chief business development officer for the Department of Economic Development and Commerce, in an interview at her office. She said her office was starting an ad campaign aimed at the new crypto expat boom, with the tagline ‚ÄúParadise Performs.‚Äù Others worry about the island‚Äôs being used for an experiment and talk about ‚Äúcrypto colonialism.‚Äù At a house party in San Juan, Richard Lopez, 32, who runs a pizza restaurant, Estella, in the town of Arecibo, said: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great. Lure them in with taxes, and they‚Äôll spend money.‚Äù Andria Satz, 33, who grew up in Old San Juan and works for the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico, disagreed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the tax playground for the rich,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the test case for anyone who wants to experiment. Outsiders get tax exemptions, and locals can‚Äôt get permits.‚Äù Mr. Lopez said the territory needed something to jump-start the economy. ‚ÄúWe have to find a new way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSure then, Bitcoin, why not,‚Äù Ms. Satz said, throwing up her hands. Mr. Lopez said he and a childhood friend, Rafael Perez, 31, were trying to set up a Bitcoin mine in their hometown. But electricity has been inconsistent, and mining even a single Bitcoin takes a lot of power, he said. Follow Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @NellieBowles.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters TAIPEI ‚Äî Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is planning a T$400 billion ($13.50 billion) investment to expand its research and development capacity for future technologies, a company spokeswoman said on Friday.  The initial planned investment is a ""ballpark figure"" and is for several years down the line, Elizabeth Sun told Reuters in a phone call. The proposed investment is subject to the government's ability to procure and integrate more land into the Hsinchu science park in Taiwan, which is currently full, as well as to environmental assessments, Sun added.  Hsinchu serves as the company's headquarters, a major production facility, and its research and development center, which focuses on future chip technology.  ""This piece of land, if we're able to acquire it, it would be for all the future R&D activities,"" Sun said. ""Right now we're already doing 5 nanonmeter R&D. In the future, it'll be 3 nm and beyond.""  Earlier this month, TSMC revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast due to softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market.  At the same time, it said it expects high-performance computing chips to make up a greater share of the company's growth over the next five years.

Technology,"Advertisement  Breakingviews  By                      TOM BUERKLE  JAN. 9, 2018  What do you get when you cross the feverish world of cryptocurrencies and a faded industrial giant desperate for a new lease on life? The answer, provided Tuesday by Eastman Kodak, is KodakCoin. Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012 after fumbling the shift to digital images. Now, the company is betting its future on digital currencies with an initial coin offering intended to help photographers sell their work. The announcement more than doubled Kodak‚Äôs stock, but it‚Äôs unlikely to do anything like the same to the company‚Äôs sales or profit. Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., emerged from bankruptcy in 2013, relieved of much of its debts and patents. It refocused around digital printing, packaging and a legacy film business that‚Äôs a shadow of the glory days when Paul Simon had a hit song rhapsodizing about Kodachrome. None of those has caught on. Sales fell by a third in the first three years after bankruptcy. They dropped another 8 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, to $1.1 billion, and the bottom line dipped into the red. The company‚Äôs market capitalization, nearly $30 billion at its peak in the late 1990s, fell to just $135 million early this week. The announcement of the planned blockchain platform and initial coin offering changed the stock‚Äôs trajectory. Kodak is just the latest to see the potential halo effect of cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin soared some 14-fold in 2017. In December, shares of the tiny Long Island Iced Tea tripled after it renamed itself Long Blockchain. Start-ups raised more than $3 billion with initial coin offerings last year, led by Filecoin, a blockchain data-storage network that raked in $257 million. Yet the field is growing crowded. ICO Alert lists roughly 80 offerings in the market and a similar number planned in the next two months. Jeffrey J. Clarke, Kodak‚Äôs chief executive, will take whatever he can get. The company has been looking for assets to sell to pay down some of its $845 million in debt, according to Eikon data. A blockchain platform could give photographers a better way to license their images and receive payment. But it‚Äôs hard to see how that will reverse Kodak‚Äôs decades-long decline.

Sports,"Things turned when the Warriors signed Kevin Durant because fans want ‚ÄúHulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant, not for them to tag-team together.‚Äù CreditChris Morris Supported by By Benjamin Hoffman After securing his seventh consecutive appearance in the N.B.A. finals, LeBron James, considered by some to be approaching Michael Jordan‚Äôs level of greatness, spent his postgame interview last Thursday talking about getting ready for ‚Äúthe juggernaut out West.‚Äù Las Vegas has made his defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers heavy underdogs to the Golden State Warriors, and social media has exploded with discussions about whether the Cavaliers can avoid a sweep. The Warriors, for some, have become the ‚ÄúBig Bad‚Äù that Cleveland will try to vanquish. After a few years as the darlings of the league, Golden State has found that its reputation has evolved, and while any backlash against it has been far from universal, it has at times embraced the heel turn as just another step in its relentless pursuit of basketball perfection. If they had to become villains along the way, so be it. Even Stephen Curry, who still looks almost childlike while knocking down 30-footers, has worn the black hat, playing to the darker version of the Warriors when asked to preview the series, which begins Thursday. ‚ÄúIt looks like they‚Äôre having fun,‚Äù Curry told reporters. ‚ÄúWe want to do something about that.‚Äù That attitude may seem surprising to those who know the Warriors mostly for their long 3-pointers and exuberant celebrations. But even as the Charles Barkleys of the world wrote off Curry and Klay Thompson as soft, the Warriors worked to surround them with teammates willing to mix things up. Draymond Green is the face, and flailing appendages, of that effort, and Zaza Pachulia, like Andrew Bogut before him, provides a hard edge to the roster as well. It was Pachulia who stepped under Kawhi Leonard‚Äôs foot on a defensive closeout in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, knocking the San Antonio Spurs star out of the series with an injured ankle and drawing the ire of Coach Gregg Popovich who likened the play to manslaughter. But even as people have clung to the incident, and pointed to other similar actions from Pachulia‚Äôs past, he has brushed off the criticism. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all history for me,‚Äù Pachulia said during Wednesday‚Äôs news media session. ‚ÄúIf you want to win, you have to be strong not only physically but mentally.‚Äù Perhaps no one has embraced the role of villain more than the team‚Äôs owner, Joe Lacob, who let his Silicon Valley brashness border on Lex Luthor-like megalomania after Golden State‚Äôs sweep of the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference finals. Lacob skipped right past praising his team and started discussing the unfinished business it had against the Cavaliers, a team that was still battling the Boston Celtics for the right to appear in the finals. ‚ÄúWe were the better team, but they did win,‚Äù Lacob said of last season‚Äôs finals, brushing off his team‚Äôs collapse after building a three-games-to-one lead. ‚ÄúWe need a chance to go in there and prove that.‚Äù Despite that, the idea that the Warriors, who have been so thoroughly embraced by the game‚Äôs youngest fans, can be regarded as anything but darlings seems a bit absurd. Jeff Van Gundy, the former N.B.A. coach who will be calling the finals for ABC, said the Warriors‚Äô embrace of the bad-guy role may simply be an iteration of their efforts to remain motivated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre villains,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôre nice guys. I think they think people are criticizing them, but all I see is 99 percent overwhelming praise.‚Äù Van Gundy‚Äôs broadcast partner, Mark Jackson, the Warriors‚Äô coach immediately before their three-year run of striking regular-season success, agreed with Van Gundy that the idea of the public turning against them was mostly in their heads. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre great guys and they‚Äôve been able to accomplish a whole heck of a lot,‚Äù Jackson said. ‚ÄúWhen you get to this level you look for different ways of motivation and you‚Äôre searching for it, but it‚Äôs been a love-fest as far as the Warriors are concerned.‚Äù If there has been a backlash, though, it is easy to establish its origins: the Warriors‚Äô off-season acquisition of Kevin Durant. An All-N.B.A. performer and the last player to win a Most Valuable Player Award before Curry‚Äôs two-year run, Durant followed the Oklahoma City Thunder‚Äôs painful loss to the Warriors in last year‚Äôs Western Conference finals by packing his bags and heading to Oakland as a free agent. It was a move that did not sit well with most anyone outside the Warriors‚Äô fan base. ‚ÄúI knew the backlash was coming; I knew how many people would ‚Äòhate‚Äô me,‚Äù Durant told  The Vertical in an interview in which he insisted that hate be placed in quotation marks when it appeared in an article. While Durant may have understood that his decision would be unpopular, he very likely did not guess how seriously people would continue to react to the move nearly a year later. In a recent conference call, the basketball analyst Kenny Smith laughed at the idea that a backlash against Golden State could come from any other source. He said the move would have implications for Durant‚Äôs legacy and for the Warriors‚Äô reputation regardless of whether they win a championship. Smith, who won two N.B.A. titles with the Houston Rockets in his 10-year career, said that the move was as egregious as James‚Äôs decision to leave Cleveland and play with his friends in Miami before the 2010-11 season, and that it would not be forgotten anytime soon. ‚ÄúCould you imagine if Larry Bird lost in the N.B.A. finals and went to the Lakers the next year?‚Äù Smith asked. ‚ÄúI would hate Bird. I wanted Bird to be the alpha.‚Äù Smith said that the marriage between the Warriors and Durant would be a problem with fans no matter how this season turns out. ‚ÄúThey want Hulk Hogan versus Andre the Giant,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúnot for them to tag-team together.‚Äù Regardless of how Durant‚Äôs decision has been received, the move made a team that seemed nearly perfect even better. The Warriors became just the third N.B.A. team since the 1956-57 season to enter the finals without having lost a playoff game, and their dominance has led many to complain that the postseason has become nothing more than a formality. Durant, perhaps frustrated that anyone could be bored by some of the best basketball that has ever been played, brushed the critics aside, saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt watch it.‚Äù That statement, which seemed cold and distant from a player who has never been thought of as either, earned Durant a great deal of criticism. Van Gundy said that he did not have any problem with the remark and that it seemed reasonable in light of all of the blowout wins. ‚ÄúI took Durant‚Äôs advice,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI did turn it off.‚Äù The time for tuning out, however, is over. Starting Thursday, the Warriors will try to take back the title Lacob, the team‚Äôs owner, felt was rightfully theirs last season, with James, and perhaps the best group of teammates he has ever had, standing in their way. Whether looking for vengeance with Durant along for the ride makes Golden State darlings or villains is up to the people at home.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Warriors 132, Cavaliers 113 | Warriors lead the series, 2-0 By Harvey Araton OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî If welcoming back Steve Kerr, their ailing coach, were not enough to inspire the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night, Klay Thompson timed the return of his missing shooting touch for the occasion of a 132-113 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers and a two-games-to-none lead in the N.B.A. finals. The sight of Kerr, who had not coached since early in the postseason as he dealt with complications from back surgery in 2015, roused the sellout crowd at Oracle Arena. But it was the 3-point shooting fireworks by Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and, finally, Thompson that electrified the fans and deflated the Cavs, who go home now for Game 3 on Wednesday night, positioned where they were last year, when they rallied to win the title in seven games. How they gather themselves to deal with the tornado the Warriors have become with Durant remains to be seen. In Game 2, Curry exploded for the first playoff triple-double of his career: 32 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists. Durant continued his dominance with 33 points and 13 rebounds, and Thompson, who made just 3 of 16 Game 1 shots, added 22 points. In all, the Warriors ‚Äî 14-0 in this postseason ‚Äî made 18 3-point shots, riddling the Cavaliers from outside after destroying them in the lane in Game 1. LeBron James had a triple-double of his own to lead the Cavaliers with 29 points, 11 rebounds and 14 assists, though he faltered in the fourth quarter, and Kevin Love had 27 points. Of his first game back, Kerr said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes it fun, to be on the sidelines, feel the energy.‚Äù A fair amount was provided by his players after they heard ‚Äî though not from him ‚Äî that Kerr was back. ‚ÄúI heard when I got to the arena that he was doing his press conference,‚Äù Curry said. ‚ÄúFor me, social media tells you everything,‚Äù said Draymond Green, who learned of Kerr‚Äôs return by checking his smartphone. ‚ÄúIt was obviously great to have him back on the sideline ‚Äî still business as usual.‚Äù While the Warriors were heartened to have Kerr back, the Cavaliers motivated themselves with the belief, or hope, that the beating they took in Game 1 was just a slap in the figurative face, a cruel but beneficial reminder that the Eastern Conference portion of the playoffs had been the equivalent of prepping to fight a heavyweight champion by sparring with a lightweight. ‚ÄúYou cannot simulate what they bring to the table, no matter how many days you have to prepare,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a lot of great teams, and they rank right up there.‚Äù The Cavs talked bravely about how they had sabotaged themselves with 20 turnovers in Game 1, how they would, with 48 minutes of adjustment time under their belts, match the Warriors‚Äô intensity and pace. Even Kerr acknowledged that the Cavaliers‚Äô turnovers in Game 1 ‚Äî and the Warriors‚Äô contrasting number ‚Äî had been an anomaly. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt expect to force 20 turnovers, we don‚Äôt expect to only have four ourselves,‚Äù he said. He was right about his team, which would turn the ball over eight times in the first quarter alone and 20 for the game, providing Kerr the opportunity to find something to complain about. ‚ÄúWe play the same game in Cleveland, we‚Äôre not going to win,‚Äù he said. Even with all the giveaways, the Warriors still were a virtual tidal wave of offense. The Cavs had promised to tighten up their interior defense but wound up surrendering five 3-pointers ‚Äî three by Durant and two by Curry, who also did serious damage from the free-throw line, hitting 10 straight en route to a 15-point first quarter. The slumping Thompson hit two of his first three shots and continued harassing Kyrie Irving, who scored one basket in the quarter and had a jumper blocked from behind by Durant, leading to a Durant basket off the kind of run-out the Cavaliers had been hoping to avoid. When the quarter ended, the Warriors, albeit sloppy, had dropped 40 points on the Cavaliers and had a 6-point lead that they soon extended to 12, at 50-38. But James, as Kerr said, was on a King-size mission, carrying the Cavs, finding Love and others for open looks and layups, embellishing a first-half stat line that would read this way at the half: 18 points, 10 assists, 6 rebounds and 2 steals. Leading at the break by 3, the Warriors tried early in the third to put the Cavs away, opening an 83-73 lead as Curry hit a 3; two free throws, after baiting J. R. Smith into a foul; and a driving layup, after dribbling James dizzy in a defensive switch ‚Äî ‚Äúlike a chicken without a head,‚Äù Curry said of that madcap possession. But James retaliated with a 3-pointer, added a driving lefty layup and found Irving breaking behind the pack for a layup, closing Cleveland‚Äôs deficit to 86-82. What the Warriors have proved ‚Äî and even more so since adding Durant ‚Äî is that they land punches in lethal combinations. That 4-point lead grew to 6 on two free throws by Shaun Livingston; then 9, on a Durant break layup and free throw off Curry‚Äôs deflection of a James pass to the post; then 11, when Curry took a rebound upcourt and found Livingston filling the left lane. The rout was on in the fourth quarter and even James could not stop it. ‚ÄúEvery mistake you make, they make you pay,‚Äù Tyronn Lue, the Cavaliers‚Äô coach, said. ‚ÄúYou saw that tonight.‚Äù As on every game night during this unblemished playoff season.

By Judith Dupr√© BUILT The Hidden Stories Behind Our Structures By Roma Agrawal Illustrated. 300 pp. Bloomsbury. $28. Once, in a younger America, architects and engineers alike were simply called ‚Äúbuilders‚Äù: people, mostly men, who had both design and construction skills. But after the American Institute of Architects was founded in 1857, the professions split. Architects began to garner all the glory while engineers toiled in their shadows. At the 1964 dedication of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, then the world‚Äôs longest suspension bridge, Robert Moses actually seemed to forget the name of Othmar Ammann, its designer and arguably the greatest engineer of the last century, referring to him only as ‚Äúa Swiss.‚Äù Such oversights have become rarer these days in the face of societal and environmental changes that demand we use and waste less. Engineers are responding with astonishing solutions culled from multiple disciplines. Supertall buildings like One World Trade Center, Shanghai Tower and the Shard are touching new ceilings of safety, sustainability and efficiency. Mimicking nature, infrastructure can now self-diagnose and self-heal when problems arise. Uses for graphene, one atom thick and the strongest material yet, are still a twinkle in the structural imagination, but not for long. Engineers are saving the world. If that sounds like a grand claim, it‚Äôs because engineering is so seamlessly integrated into every facet of our lives that it is all but invisible. Drawing on varied examples across centuries and continents, Roma Agrawal‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuilt‚Äù seeks to tell this untold history ‚Äî for, as the author claims, the ‚Äúengineered universe is a narrative full of stories and secrets.‚Äù Agrawal is a rarity: a female structural engineer in an adamantly male profession. A self-proclaimed ‚Äúgeek,‚Äù she shares her discoveries far above and below ground with an enthusiasm worthy of Dora the Explorer. She will inspire young women who are considering a career in engineering. In early chapters, Agrawal slowly builds a foundation on familiar concepts, but your patience will soon be rewarded with more esoteric investigations into ‚Äúhidden engineering.‚Äù Two of the most interesting chapters ‚Äî ‚ÄúPure‚Äù and ‚ÄúClean‚Äù ‚Äî examine water and the technologies that have been developed to collect and process it. No one cares ‚Äúabout poo,‚Äù a drainage engineer complains in ‚ÄúClean.‚Äù Agrawal disagrees. In fact, she shines when explaining the sorts of things people might be too shy to admit they find inherently fascinating. In Japan, for instance, Agrawal tries out an amped-up toilet, itself an engineering marvel of heat, water and music. She then leaps back to the 18th century, when Japan traded in solid human waste, a valuable agricultural commodity for an island with little land and a growing population. As the ‚Äúturd trade‚Äù boomed, laws were enacted that entitled landlords to their tenants‚Äô feces (but not their urine). Agrawal hopscotches to London and its once sewage-filled Thames, commemorated as ‚ÄúMonster Soup‚Äù in an 1828 etching, one of the book‚Äôs many black-and-white illustrations. The river‚Äôs stench was so rank that at last, in 1859, city officials approved Joseph Bazalgette‚Äôs proposal for a new sewage system. Nearly 20 years in the making and 1,300 miles long, that network also created space for the London Tube, the first underground railway. The sewers moved untreated effluent from central London and out to sea. Agrawal notes that ‚Äúit may come as a surprise to learn that we use exactly the same system today.‚Äù Enter the engineers. Work has begun on the Thames Tideway Tunnel. When completed in 2023, this massive infrastructure project will expand the existing system and divert waste to treatment plants before releasing it to the sea. Most of this super-sewer will run beneath the riverbed, eliminating the need to dig up city streets and the strata of foundations and utilities beneath them. Equally ingenious is their plan to use the river to transport 90 percent of construction material. The amount of wastewater into the Thames will be reduced from 62 million to 2.4 million tons annually. Economy, for engineers as well as poets, is the sum definition of beauty.

Sports,"Advertisement  Q&A;  By                       SCOTT CACCIOLA   JUNE 24, 2017  There are decorated athletes, and then there is Bill Russell. As the dominant man in the middle for the Boston Celtics from 1956 to 1969, Russell was a 12-time All-Star selection. He won 11 N.B.A. championships, the last two as the team‚Äôs player-coach. He won the rare triple of Olympic gold medal, N.B.A. championship and college title. Indeed, he won two of those at the University of San Francisco. But even as Russell, 83, revolutionized the game with his defensive prowess from the center position, he may have made his greatest impact as a civil rights pioneer. He was the first African-American to coach a major professional sports team. In 2011, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This month, he appeared on a dais with the Golden State Warriors to present Kevin Durant with the N.B.A. finals‚Äô Most Valuable Player Award ‚Äî an award that is named after Russell. There is more: On Monday, Russell will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the inaugural N.B.A. Awards show, which will be broadcast by TNT at 9 p.m. Eastern. Russell, who plans to attend the ceremony, was recently interviewed by telephone from his home in the Seattle area. This interview has been edited and condensed. Advertisement  In light of your most recent award, what do you feel are your meaningful contributions to the game? I was a part of a wave of black players that came into the league and played successfully. Before my time, everybody thought of black players as the Harlem Globetrotters. People expected comedy, and they didn‚Äôt get it. So it was a newly respected level of black players ‚Äî that we were not Globetrotters but very good players. You had guys like Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor ‚Äî they could play! And you could not just give them a pat on the head, you know? They eliminated the ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù label. In fact, I remember how Jerry West was respected ‚Äî they used to say that he played like he was black. Advertisement I was also the first player recognized for my defense rather than my offense. I think those are examples of how I may have helped change the game.  A lot of today‚Äôs stars are using their platform to speak out about issues that are important to them, including race relations and gun violence. Are you heartened by the level of social awareness exhibited by some of the players of this generation?  I suppose. I think that every generation throughout the whole society have social issues that they deal with. And this generation is no different. The issues are different, but the fact that they‚Äôre dealing with them is not different.  What do you think of today‚Äôs style of play? What do you like about the game, and what don‚Äôt you like?

It‚Äôs more one-on-one. I thought it was a team game, and they‚Äôre getting away from the team aspect and more into one-on-one. And I don‚Äôt subscribe to that. What we should be working toward is trying to take the team concept to its final conclusion: The best team will be the best team. It‚Äôs changed.  The Golden State Warriors are probably the best example of that team concept in today‚Äôs N.B.A. Given your style of play, do you think you could have fit with that team? When you look back and compare the ‚Äô50s and the ‚Äô60s with today‚Äôs Warriors, I think you‚Äôll find that they had a lot in common. In my day, I was just playing basketball ‚Äî and I could play. I remember when I went to the Celtics, there were questions about whether I could fit in with that group because they were known for being a very offensive team. Red Auerbach, when I got there, he says, ‚ÄúYou may be worried about playing with this team. But I‚Äôm the coach, and you‚Äôll fit.‚Äù Some folks tried to encourage me to say that I wanted to play someplace where the team was more defense-oriented. And my attitude was, ‚ÄúI can play and will play defense here.‚Äù There were very serious questions if I could play pro ball, you know? Some said that I couldn‚Äôt shoot free throws, couldn‚Äôt do this, couldn‚Äôt do that. And I was glad that they said that, because those were the guys that I beat the hell out of. Advertisement  We‚Äôre seeing all these centers launching 3-pointers now. If the 3-point line had existed during your era, would you have tried to develop a 3-point shot?  No. Take the game like you find it and play it to the best of your ability.  So you‚Äôre not jealous of them?  Not at all! That‚Äôs the only kind of shot they can get off! A Q. and A. interview on Sunday with the basketball great Bill Russell erroneously attributed a distinction to him.

Sports,"Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJUNE 12, 2017  After the Golden State Warriors failed to finish off the Cleveland Cavaliers in last year‚Äôs N.B.A. finals, blowing a 3-1 lead in the series, they knew they needed to get better if they wanted to go from a one-time title winner to a dynasty. So the team aggressively pursued superstar Kevin Durant in free agency. The former M.V.P. was worth every penny, leading the Warriors to their second championship in three years. Durant, who became just the sixth player in N.B.A. history to score 30 or more points in each game of a finals, had 39 in the series-clinching Game 5 victory. He proved his value all over the court with dominant play inside, great outside shooting and tenacious defense as the Warriors beat the Cavaliers 129-120.              Kevin Durant...from WAY downtown.@warriors have taken the lead on #NBAonABC. pic.twitter.com/JPevoogqyl  Here are the key takeaways from Game 5: ‚ñ† Durant, in his first year with the Warriors, was an easy choice as Finals M.V.P. as he became just the sixth player to score 30 or more points in each game of a championship round. He joined Elgin Baylor (1962), Rick Barry (1967), Michael Jordan (1993), Hakeem Olajuwon (1995) and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal (2000, 2002). ‚ñ† The fact that Stephen Curry averaged 26.8 points, 9.4 assists and 8 rebounds a game in the series and didn‚Äôt receive any votes for M.V.P. says a lot about Durant‚Äôs dominant performance. The competition may have been closer had Curry not had a terrible Game 4, in which he scored just 14 points in the Warriors‚Äô loss. Advertisement ‚ñ† Despite having nearly the entire roster eligible for free agency, the Warriors are expected to bring the entire core back next year. It‚Äôs not a stretch to say the Warriors have the seeds for a dynasty, with two titles in three seasons to go with a record-setting three-year regular season run (207-39 record). But considering the Cavaliers‚Äô dominance in the Eastern Conference playoffs, there is little to reason these teams will not be back next season for a fourth finals matchup in a row.

He and Kyrie Irving were phenomenal for most of the series, but there will be plenty of hand-wringing to come over the Cavs‚Äô roster. Kevin Love, who disappeared in Game 5, will be in the hot seat. Advertisement ‚ñ† The Warriors will hold a victory parade in Oakland on Thursday at 10 a.m. Pacific. The parade will begin at Broadway and 11th St. and will end at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center. Fans are allowed to assemble for the parade as early as 5 a.m. ‚ñ† In a tear-filled interview on the court after the game, Kevin Durant said he had not slept in two days and was anxious and jittery before the game, but all of that was over now. ‚ÄúWe prevailed,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre champions and we did it on our own floor.‚Äù ‚ñ† Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, who has won titles in two of his three seasons as a coach, took the opportunity to praise himself in a tongue-in-cheek manner. ‚ÄúWe have very little talent, actually, it was most coaching,‚Äù he deadpanned before saying he had the best job in the world. ‚ñ† LeBron James, when asked how it felt to lose a championship despite averaging a triple double, put things in perspective for the reporter. ‚ÄúIt would be the same if you wrote the best column of your life and somebody picked another one over you,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúHow would you feel? So you wouldn‚Äôt hold your head down, but you would be like, O.K., it‚Äôs just not my time.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ñ† In praising his team, Joe Lacob, the Warriors‚Äô owner, singled out Stephen Curry and Draymond Green before adding ‚Äúand Kevin, thanks for coming‚Äù to which Durant smiled and replied ‚Äúyes, sir!‚Äù ‚ñ† In familiar fashion, the loquacious Draymond Green was the most willing player to talk, addressing his Game 5 suspension last year, which many cited as a reason for the team‚Äôs eventual collapse. ‚ÄúWe had a letdown last year, I had a letdown last year,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúBut, like I told everyone before, if Kevin Durant was the consolation prize to lose, thanks for that loss.‚Äù Here‚Äôs how the Warriors won Game 5: Game 5 was underway at 9:11 p.m. Eastern when Tristan Thompson of the Cavaliers won the opening tip over Zaza Pachulia of the Warriors. After a chippy Game 4, Klay Thompson was whistled for a foul just 12 seconds into Game 5 as the referees try to set an early precedent. After a little more than two minutes of play, the Warriors were leading 6-4 thanks to a technical free-throw caused by a 3-second violation, a Kevin Durant layup and a Draymond Green 3-pointer. Kevin Love was forced to the bench early in the quarter thanks to two quick fouls as the referees have continued to call the game tightly. But the Cavaliers absolutely exploded after he came out of the game with a combination of aggressive defense and quality offense. Kyrie Irving stole the ball from Stephen Curry and LeBron James intercepted an outlet pass and suddenly a 9-4 lead for the Warriors had turned into a 13-9 advantage for the Cavaliers. Coach Steve Kerr had seen enough of Cleveland‚Äôs momentum-stealing play and called a timeout with just under nine minutes remaining in the quarter. The Cavaliers are 6 for 7 from the field so far. The Cavaliers have continued to play an incredibly physical style on defense, and it has thus far greatly frustrated the Warriors, who can‚Äôt seem to find open shots and can‚Äôt get to the rim to make up for it. Meanwhile the tightly-called game has resulted in Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant both joining Kevin Love with two fouls in the quarter. Advertisement Draymond Green specifically mentioned early fouls as a reason for Golden State not being able to play aggressively in Game 4, so Thompson and Durant both altering their style on the defensive end could certainly be impactful in this game. LeBron James has not cooled off at all in a finals in which he has been nearly unstoppable. He is already up to 12 points, with the rest of his team combining for 10. With Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Kevin Love all on the bench with early foul trouble, the game had a few more first quarter participants than expected, and the Cavaliers were able to take advantage, with a 37-33 lead. The fouls and turnovers have been heavy on both sides in a tightly-contested but sloppy game. But after the Warriors briefly took a lead with 37 seconds remaining in the quarter, it was all Cleveland, with the Cavaliers going on a 6-0 run. LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry all tied as the top scorer in the quarter with 12 points, though Irving came off as the most impressive, hitting seemingly unmakeable shots and scoring four points end of the quarter. The Warriors are only losing by two points with 7:38 remaining in the quarter despite having gone 2 for 11 from 3-point range in Game 5. The cold shooting has prevented what could be a near blowout if they were shooting up to their usual standards, but they appear to be adjusting some, with Andre Iguodala making a statement with a huge dunk over LeBron James. Cleveland is still getting outsized contributions from Kyrie Irving and James, but if they want to build a cushion in time to hold off Golden State‚Äôs shooters from warming up, they will have to get more from the rest of the team. Kevin Love, who has played just 7 minutes because of foul trouble, is definitely someone they need back in and scoring. It looked like the Warriors could be in trouble when Draymond Green picked up two fouls in a span of just six seconds, but after Kevin Love missed a pair of free-throws, Kevin Durant hit a 3-pointer that gave the lead back to Golden State. Then the Warriors‚Äô potent offense woke up. The Cavaliers have continued to play sloppy on both ends of the court and the Warriors took advantage, going on a 21-2 run that finally ended when J.R. Smith hit a long 2-pointer. With just under four minutes remaining, the Warrior have a 15-point advantage and are in control. David West came down with a rebound and got tangled up with Kyrie Irving. They fought for the ball and as they were separating, West shoved Irving with his free hand, earning himself a technical foul. Advertisement West then compounded matters by going chest-to-chest with Tristan Thompson. The officials took a long look at the review to determine how to call the play, and ended up giving technical fouls to both Thompson and J.R. Smith, who got involved after the fact. West avoided being hit with a double-technical, which would have resulted in his ejection. The first half of Game 5 felt a lot like the second half of Game 4 in terms of aggressiveness and chippiness between the teams, but the results have been far more in Golden State‚Äôs favor, with a 21-2 run early in the second quarter opening up a healthy lead for the Warriors. Golden State led, 71-60, at halftime. The tensions of the game reached their apex late in the second quarter when David West tussled with both Kyrie Irving and Tristan Thompson, but even in that chaos the Golden State offensive machine continued to churn. The Warriors ended up outscoring the Cavaliers 38-23 in the quarter, playing tight defense and leaving Cleveland‚Äôs players searching for answers. LeBron James and Kevin Durant tied for the first-half lead with 21 points, but in the biggest offensive departure from Game 4, Stephen Curry was nearly as hot, scoring 20. After starting the game 2 for 12 from 3-point range, the Warriors closed the first half making 5 of their last 7 attempts. Cleveland‚Äôs Kevin Love got into early foul trouble and finished the half with 0 points. For Cleveland to get back into the game in the second half they will need to cut down on turnovers, slow down the Warriors‚Äô offense, and quiet down the crowd in Oakland, which has reached raucous levels. Klay Thompson opened up the second half with a 3-pointer over Kevin Love, but a series of fouls and mistakes has let Cleveland get off to a mild 11-8 advantage in the third quarter. J.R. Smith has continued the hot shooting he showed at the end of the first half and with the Golden State lead now in single digits, the Warriors took a timeout to regroup and to slow down the Cleveland momentum. The Cavaliers have been a team reborn in the second half, fighting for rebounds, getting to the hoop and not making anything easy for the Warriors. Advertisement The aggressiveness of the referees in the first half created numerous open looks for the Warriors‚Äô shooters, but with their backs against the wall, Cleveland appears to have decided it is time to ignore the possibility of fouls and go after the Warriors. Golden State‚Äôs advantage is holding up, with an Andre Iguodala dunk giving them a 10-point lead with five minutes remaining in the third quarter, but the Cavaliers found a blueprint for frustrating the Warriors, and are looking to exploit it to avoid another extended run like the one that nearly sunk them in the second quarter. Cleveland cut the Golden State lead all the way down to 4 points with 3:33 remaining in the third quarter, but Kevin Durant showed exactly why the Warriors wanted him by nailing a perfect 3-pointer that brought the lead back to seven and forced the Cavaliers to take a timeout. As things fell apart in last year‚Äôs finals, the Warriors struggled to answer the domination of LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, but Durant has proved to be the offensive equalizer they were missing when Cleveland works to trap Stephen Curry and thus negate his offensive ability. The Warriors are now 12 minutes from the team‚Äôs second championship in three seasons, as they enter the fourth quarter with a 98-93 lead over the Cavaliers. Golden State has received huge games from Kevin Durant (28 points) and Stephen Curry (25), but has also gotten a lot of help with 28 points off the bench (compared to 4 from Cleveland‚Äôs reserves). Andre Iguodala has been the top bench contributor with 13 points, but Patrick McCaw, the Golden State rookie, was also a tenacious contributor in the third quarter and has 6 key points in the game. There has been no quit in Cleveland, despite Golden State occasionally opening up double-digit leads. They stayed turnover-free in the third quarter, and if there is anything holding them back from a fourth-quarter comeback it may be the health of Kyrie Irving. Irving has 26 points thus far and LeBron James has 27. If not for a total disappearing act by Kevin Love, who has 2 points, Cleveland might not be losing. LeBron James was the first to score in the fourth quarter, with a powerful drive to the basket against Kevin Durant, but Durant was able to answer with a turnaround jumper over James to equalize the points. The battle of wills between arguably the two best players in the game has provided plenty of entertainment in a series that was initially written off as boring when Games 1 and 2 were blowouts. After a pair of free-throws by Draymond Green, the Warriors have increased their lead to 10 points with 9:17 remaining in the game, and James has headed to the bench for a short rest so he can be fresh at the end of the game. With LeBron James on the bench, Cleveland got one point from a Kevin Love free throw but after a timeout ‚Äî and just 27 seconds of clock time ‚Äî James was back on the court. Despite James‚Äôs return, the Warriors got dunks from Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala and increased their lead to 112-102 with 7:42 remaining in the game.

Technology,"Advertisement By MAYA SALAMMARCH 2, 2018  ‚ÄúNo means no‚Äù began to give way to ‚Äúyes means yes‚Äù as the credo of sexual consent decades ago, but the shift has been swiftly propelled in recent years by legislation and, most recently, by the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The concept of affirmative consent ‚Äî the act of giving verbal permission clearly and often during intimate encounters ‚Äî was pioneered at Antioch College, where an affirmative sexual consent policy was instituted in 1990. It was widely mocked then, but similar policies have since spread to campuses nationwide, and today, the concept is acknowledged well beyond university grounds. Now, apps aiming to help partners mitigate confusion in the bedroom have emerged, the newest of which approaches consent like a legal contract. LegalFling, which was introduced to users in beta on Monday, lets users give explicit sexual consent via an agreement, or a ‚Äúlive contract,‚Äù a dynamic document that users can continuously interact with and update. And yes, these agreements could hold up in court, said Andrew D. Cherkasky, a former special victims prosecutor who now handles dozens of felony-level sexual assault cases each year as a criminal defense attorney. He emphasized, however, that what LegalFling offers are not technically contracts, but documentations of intent, which are legally viable. Advertisement LegalFling aims to make the sexual dos and don‚Äôts explicit in a ‚Äúfun and clear way,‚Äù according to its website. Condom use, bondage, dirty talk, sexting: the app lets users set their boundaries before an encounter ‚Äî boundaries that can be adjusted at any time with a tap and shared with a potential partner. (Sound familiar? Netflix‚Äôs twisted-tech series ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù incorporated a similar transaction in its episode ‚ÄúHang the DJ.‚Äù) Advertisement ‚ÄúA profile update is an event we store on the blockchain and will subsequently update the live contract,‚Äù Rick Schmitz, a co-creator of LegalFling, recently said. The transaction is encrypted, timestamped and stored. (A blockchain is a collection of digital transactions that are registered in a sequence of ‚Äúblocks‚Äù of data.) Will these apps revolutionize sex? Not likely. As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving. Dr. Michelle Drouin, a leading expert on technology and relationships, said the apps are good at documenting consent, but don‚Äôt account much for fluctuating human emotions. They don‚Äôt necessarily allow for any immediacy of one‚Äôs feelings, she said. Use of the app ‚Äúhas to be planned,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now.‚Äù Mr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that‚Äôs not always possible. If encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record. Advertisement Also possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website. The creators of LegalFling, part of the blockchain company LegalThings, which digitized regulation for the Dutch government, said they decided to apply their technology to sexual consent when, in December, Sweden proposed a law that would require people to get explicit verbal consent before sexual contact.

View all New York Times newsletters. But Dr. Drouin is not sold on apps as a solution to a very human problem. The requirement to interact with an app during a sexual encounter is ‚Äúcompletely unrealistic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, ‚ÄòWait a second, I‚Äôm changing my mind on the app and also with you,‚Äô‚Äù she said. More important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous. These digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual‚Äôs intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. ‚ÄúWe already see it all the time in social media or text messages,‚Äù he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well. But these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It‚Äôs very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a ‚Äúgreat deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things,‚Äù he said. Even implying that someone doesn‚Äôt have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if ‚Äúthe box wasn‚Äôt checked.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time,‚Äù he said. Advertisement But technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said. Dr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer ‚Äòhe said, she said.‚Äô‚Äù While LegalFling is the newest app hoping to address the rising tide of consent awareness, it‚Äôs not the first. We-Consent, introduced in 2015 by the nonprofit Institute for the Study of Coherence and Emergence, was created for students on college campuses to help them adhere to the implementation of affirmative consent rules. In 2014, California became the first state to require colleges to use affirmative consent as the standard in disciplinary decisions, which inspired the creation of We-Consent, said Michael Lissack, director of the institute. We-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition. There are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances ‚Äî before We-Consent turned in the videos ‚Äî the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said. ‚ÄúFrom Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they‚Äôre going to do with one another,‚Äù he said. Consent can happen only from discussion, he said, ‚Äúnot from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement.‚Äù Follow Maya Salam on Twitter: @Maya__Salam A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2018, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Consent in Digital Age:  Can These Apps Solve  A Very Human Problem?.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper and Steve Lohr Frank Yiannas has spent years looking in vain for a better way to track lettuce, steaks and snack cakes from farm and factory to the shelves of Walmart, where he is the vice president for food safety. When the company dealt with salmonella outbreaks, it often took weeks to trace where the bad ingredients came from. Then, last year, IBM executives flew to Walmart‚Äôs headquarters in Arkansas to propose a solution: the blockchain. As Mr. Yiannas studied their pitch, he said, ‚ÄúI became increasingly convinced that maybe we were onto the holy grail.‚Äù The blockchain ‚Äî the buzzy, bewildering technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ‚Äî is starting to be applied to real-world problems like tracking pork chops, shipping containers and footwear with a speed and security not currently possible. The IBM-Walmart partnership is one of the biggest practical tests to date. At its heart, blockchain simply refers to a bookkeeping method that ‚Äúchains‚Äù together entries so that they are very difficult to modify later. It provides a way for large groups of unrelated companies to jointly keep a secure and reliable record of their transactions. IBM is trying to position itself at the forefront of the heated competition for practical uses of this arcane idea. Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology. The most immediate business opportunities are in the financial world as a tool to track and trade stocks, bonds and other assets. But in the next week, Maersk, the global shipping giant, is expected to announce it is using IBM‚Äôs version of the blockchain to track the avocados, flowers and machine parts it carries on its enormous cargo ships. Last month, the government of Dubai said it was working with IBM to trace the goods flowing through its ports. Yet success is far from assured. Rival Microsoft said this past week that it was working with JPMorgan Chase and several other corporate giants on a system that competes against IBM‚Äôs, based on the virtual currency network known as Ethereum. Many banks are concerned that IBM could push them into a version of the blockchain that would lock them into IBM‚Äôs software. ‚ÄúWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it‚Äôs going to matter,‚Äù Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft‚Äôs blockchain efforts, said of the technology. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a question of where‚Äôs its going to matter and how it‚Äôs going to matter.‚Äù It was Bitcoin that first caught the attention of IBM researchers, and everyone else. Bitcoin, born in 2009, represented a novel idea in the financial world. Unlike, say, dollars or yen, Bitcoins are virtual tokens, unaffiliated with any nation. Anyone can open a wallet and receive Bitcoins ‚Äî without providing any identifying information ‚Äî and transactions are recorded on a universal ledger that is visible to everyone. Drug dealers have embraced its relative anonymity. And people who live in countries that strictly control their financial systems, like China and Venezuela, have used Bitcoin to store their money beyond the watchful eye of the government. But while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin‚Äôs underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into ‚Äúblocks,‚Äù and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction ‚Äî a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact. In 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM. ‚ÄúI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,‚Äù said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM. But a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM‚Äôs central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology. They explained that this was about more than just a currency ‚Äî it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it. ‚ÄúThat was the ‚Äòaha‚Äô for me,‚Äù Mr. Krishna said. ‚ÄúThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.‚Äù He called it ‚Äúa technology that can change the world.‚Äù There are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers. But blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information. A few months after Mr. Krishna‚Äôs aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM‚Äôs top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities ‚Äî or threats ‚Äî to IBM‚Äôs business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM‚Äôs chief executive, gave the green light to. She turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, ‚ÄúYou run with this,‚Äù he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months. Her hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM‚Äôs eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software. But growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers. IBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, ‚ÄúThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.‚Äù After getting Ms. Rometty‚Äôs push on the blockchain, the IBM team‚Äôs first move was to make its software ‚Äúopen source,‚Äù meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM‚Äôs bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology. It was the chairman of IBM Europe, Erich Clementi, who personally pitched the concept to the top technology executive at Maersk. Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe. For Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships ‚Äî instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities. While the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world. What‚Äôs more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year. Maersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved ‚Äî including Maersk and government authorities ‚Äî could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged. The first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California. The difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it‚Äôs unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system. ‚ÄúYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,‚Äù said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the difficult part.‚Äù IBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark. Not everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach. Many technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains ‚Äî like the one being built by IBM ‚Äî are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin‚Äôs success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM‚Äôs. That could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, ‚Äúit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,‚Äù said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems. The companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays. IBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come. IBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined. But the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project. ‚ÄúThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,‚Äù Mr. Behlendorf said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.‚Äù Microsoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals. But IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. ‚ÄúThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,‚Äù said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor. Now all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work. At Maersk, Mr. Stausholm said it could take five or even 10 years for that to happen, given all the partners ‚Äî manufacturers, customs officials and farmers ‚Äî that need to come together. ‚ÄúI really do believe in it,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt know how fast it will be able to take off.‚Äù At Walmart, Mr. Yiannas is more optimistic. His company has already completed two pilots with IBM ‚Äî moving pork from Chinese farms to Chinese stores, and produce from Latin America to the United States ‚Äî and he is confident a finished version can be put together within a few years. ‚ÄúI think this is our one best hope for getting it right,‚Äù he said.

Politics,"Advertisement By EILEEN SULLIVANMAY 1, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump on Tuesday said it was ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù that questions the special counsel would like to ask him were publicly disclosed, and he incorrectly noted that there were no questions about collusion. The president also said collusion was a ‚Äúphony‚Äù crime. While Mr. Trump is right that the word ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù is not included in the questions, the nature of some of the inquiries directly addresses the concept of collusion with the Russians. In an early morning Twitter post, Mr. Trump responded to a report by The New York Times on Monday that detailed the more than 40 questions the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, would like to ask Mr. Trump regarding the ongoing investigation of Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. The special counsel investigation is also looking into possible coordination with some of Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates and whether Mr. Trump has obstructed justice to interfere with the inquiry.              So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!         The questions, obtained by The Times, came from a person outside of Mr. Trump‚Äôs legal team and appear to seek answers to Mr. Trump‚Äôs motivations behind some of his tweets, his thinking and his relationships with close advisers. The special counsel also wants to question the president about the firings of his first national security adviser and the F.B.I. director, which came early in his administration. What are the most important takeaways from the questions the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, wants to ask President Trump? Times reporters discuss. In a second tweet about the inquiries, Mr. Trump said that it ‚Äúwould seem very hard‚Äù to obstruct justice if there was never a crime, and he repeated his claim that the inquiry is a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù              It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!         Advertisement A guilty verdict is not required for there to be obstruction of justice. According to federal laws, justice can be obstructed when someone knowingly interferes with an ongoing investigation. However, a longstanding Justice Department legal finding says that sitting presidents cannot be charged with a crime while they are in office. Mr. Mueller met last week with Mr. Trump‚Äôs new lawyer in the investigation, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former United States attorney and longtime friend of the president. Mr. Giuliani said he was trying to determine whether Mr. Mueller and his team were going to be ‚Äútruly objective.‚Äù Advertisement The special counsel has wanted to question Mr. Trump for months, and the president has at times said he would like to be interviewed as a way to bring the sprawling inquiry to a close.

Politics,"Advertisement By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTAPRIL 30, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia‚Äôs election interference, has at least four dozen questions on an exhaustive array of subjects he wants to ask President Trump to learn more about his ties to Russia and determine whether he obstructed the inquiry itself, according to a list of the questions obtained by The New York Times. [Read the questions here.] The open-ended queries appear to be an attempt to penetrate the president‚Äôs thinking, to get at the motivation behind some of his most combative Twitter posts and to examine his relationships with his family and his closest advisers. They deal chiefly with the president‚Äôs high-profile firings of the F.B.I. director and his first national security adviser, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. But they also touch on the president‚Äôs businesses; any discussions with his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, about a Moscow real estate deal; whether the president knew of any attempt by Mr. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel to Russia during the transition; any contacts he had with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser who claimed to have inside information about Democratic email hackings; and what happened during Mr. Trump‚Äôs 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant. Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that it was ‚Äúdisgraceful‚Äù that questions the special counsel would like to ask him were publicly disclosed, and he incorrectly noted that there were no questions about collusion. The president also said collusion was a ‚Äúphony‚Äù crime. Advertisement The questions provide the most detailed look yet inside Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy since he was appointed nearly a year ago. The majority relate to possible obstruction of justice, demonstrating how an investigation into Russia‚Äôs election meddling grew to include an examination of the president‚Äôs conduct in office. Among them are queries on any discussions Mr. Trump had about his attempts to fire Mr. Mueller himself and what the president knew about possible pardon offers to Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. Advertisement ‚ÄúWhat efforts were made to reach out to Mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon?‚Äù Mr. Mueller planned to ask, according to questions read by the special counsel investigators to the president‚Äôs lawyers, who compiled them into a list. That document was provided to The Times by a person outside Mr. Trump‚Äôs legal team. A few questions reveal that Mr. Mueller is still investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. In one of the more tantalizing inquiries, Mr. Mueller asks what Mr. Trump knew about campaign aides, including the former chairman Paul Manafort, seeking assistance from Moscow: ‚ÄúWhat knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?‚Äù No such outreach has been revealed publicly. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, declined to comment. A spokesman for the special counsel‚Äôs office did not respond to a request for comment. The questions serve as a reminder of the chaotic first 15 months of the Trump presidency and the transition and campaign before that. Mr. Mueller wanted to inquire about public threats the president made, conflicting statements from Mr. Trump and White House aides, the president‚Äôs private admissions to Russian officials, a secret meeting at an island resort, WikiLeaks, salacious accusations and dramatic congressional testimony. The special counsel also sought information from the president about his relationship with Russia. Mr. Mueller would like to ask Mr. Trump whether he had any discussions during the campaign about any meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and whether he spoke to others about either American sanctions against Russia or meeting with Mr. Putin. Through his questions, Mr. Mueller also tries to tease out Mr. Trump‚Äôs views on law enforcement officials and whether he sees them as independent investigators or people who should loyally protect him. For example, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was fired, the White House said he broke with Justice Department policy and spoke publicly about the investigation into Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs email server. Mr. Mueller‚Äôs questions put that statement to the test. He wants to ask why, time and again, Mr. Trump expressed no concerns with whether Mr. Comey had abided by policy. Rather, in statements in private and on national television, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation.

Many of the questions surround Mr. Trump‚Äôs relationship with Mr. Sessions, including the attorney general‚Äôs decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and whether Mr. Trump told Mr. Sessions he needed him in place for protection. Advertisement Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating how Mr. Trump took steps last year to fire Mr. Mueller himself. The president relented after the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to resign, an episode that the special counsel wants to ask about. ‚ÄúWhat consideration and discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel in June of 2017?‚Äù Mr. Mueller planned to ask, according to the list of questions. ‚ÄúWhat did you think and do in reaction to Jan. 25, 2018, story about the termination of the special counsel and Don McGahn backing you off the termination?‚Äù he planned to ask, referring to the Times article that broke the news of the confrontation. Mr. Mueller has sought for months to question the president, who has in turn expressed a desire, at times, to be interviewed, viewing it as an avenue to end the inquiry more quickly. His lawyers have been negotiating terms of an interview out of concern that their client ‚Äî whose exaggerations, half-truths and outright falsehoods are well documented ‚Äî could provide false statements or easily become distracted. Four people, including Mr. Flynn, have pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in the Russia inquiry. The list of questions grew out of those negotiations. In January, Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyers gave Mr. Mueller several pages of written explanations about the president‚Äôs role in the matters the special counsel is investigating. Concerned about putting the president in legal jeopardy, his lead lawyer, John Dowd, was trying to convince Mr. Mueller he did not need to interview Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Mueller was apparently unsatisfied. He told Mr. Dowd in early March that he needed to question the president directly to determine whether he had criminal intent when he fired Mr. Comey, the people said. But Mr. Dowd held firm, and investigators for Mr. Mueller agreed days later to share during a meeting with Mr. Dowd the questions they wanted to ask Mr. Trump. When Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team relayed the questions, their tone and detailed nature cemented Mr. Dowd‚Äôs view that the president should not sit for an interview. Despite Mr. Dowd‚Äôs misgivings, Mr. Trump remained firm in his insistence that he meet with Mr. Mueller. About a week and a half after receiving the questions, Mr. Dowd resigned, concluding that his client was ignoring his advice. Advertisement Mr. Trump‚Äôs new lawyer in the investigation and his longtime confidant, Rudolph W. Giuliani, met with Mr. Mueller last week and said he was trying to determine whether the special counsel and his staff were going to be ‚Äútruly objective.‚Äù Mr. Mueller‚Äôs endgame remains a mystery, even if he determines the president broke the law. A longstanding Justice Department legal finding says presidents cannot be charged with a crime while they are in office. The special counsel told Mr. Dowd in March that though the president‚Äôs conduct is under scrutiny, he is not a target of the investigation, meaning Mr. Mueller does not expect to charge him. The prospect of pardons is also among Mr. Mueller‚Äôs inquiries, and whether Mr. Trump offered them to a pair of former top aides to influence their decisions about whether to cooperate with the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd broached the idea with lawyers for both of the advisers, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Manafort, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes related to his work for the pro-Russia former president of Ukraine. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who was ousted from the White House in February 2017 amid revelations about contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, ultimately pleaded guilty last December to lying to federal authorities and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel. ‚ÄúAfter General Flynn resigned, what calls or efforts were made by people associated with you to reach out to General Flynn or to discuss Flynn seeking immunity or possible pardon?‚Äù Mr. Mueller planned to ask.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Marco Rubio After World War II, the United States helped build an international economic order on the assumption that free and fair trade benefits all partners. During the postwar years, the American economy was unmatched by any other country. The postwar boom was fueled not just by thriving domestic demand but also by trade, which opened a flow of wealth from the world‚Äôs consumers to American workers. Trade made America and our partners more prosperous and secure. This basic case for trade still stands. When we exchange goods with other nations on equal terms, both countries benefit. Maintaining the conditions that make this possible is the purpose of the international economic order that we took great care to nurture. We need to take violations of this economic order seriously. We must enforce the rules. China, in pursuit of its goals of economic and regional dominance, has been among the most egregious rule breakers. When China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States supported that decision for two reasons: We hoped to promote better access to China‚Äôs consumer markets for American companies immediately and, eventually, political liberalization within China. Neither has materialized. While the Chinese people have pushed for a somewhat more open society, the Chinese government is becoming even more autocratic. And since peaking in 2003, imports of manufactured goods into China as a share of gross domestic product have steadily declined. Instead of opening its doors to United States exports, China has thwarted competition at every turn. It has advanced Chinese state-planned businesses by stealing American intellectual property and has pressured foreign companies that want to enter the Chinese market to agree to ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù that facilitate theft and espionage. China has also bought up American assets to inflate the value of the dollar and make American exports more expensive. China has also tried to tilt the playing field in the United States  by manipulating its currency, among other tactics. ‚ÄúFree‚Äù trade with China has yielded some short-term benefits for consumers, in the form of lower prices, and for United States companies, in the form of higher profit margins. But free trade has been devastating for American workers and manufacturing. The so-called China shock, the impact of China‚Äôs entry to the international trading system, wiped out more than 2.4 million American jobs from 1999 to 2011. Ignoring China‚Äôs trade violations reinforces the view among American workers that international trade is bad for them and their way of life. President Trump is correct when he says that America has been taken advantage of. The federal government had the tools to better manage the start of trade with China, but our leaders chose not to use them. For example, in exchange for greater standing at the trade organization, China agreed to allow other countries to impose tariffs in response to sudden surges of Chinese imports, yet the United States did not impose them. The United States government still has a host of tools to defend the national interest on matters of trade. The president‚Äôs proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, are just one example. By themselves, these tariffs will not do enough to rein in China‚Äôs trade violations. Because the tariffs are broad and apply to many countries, they may not have much of an impact on the worst violators, including China. Tariffs like these penalize the production decisions companies made decades ago, so they will do more to increase the cost of business downstream, in the United States, than they will rewire the global economy to benefit American workers. We should enforce the rules by taking additional actions against China. Last year, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced its investigation of Chinese intellectual property theft under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This authority allows for a wide range of actions. The Trump administration should push its boundaries. For example, the government should impose duties on Chinese industries that benefit from stolen American intellectual property, and those penalties should be equivalent to the size of the economic loss faced by American producers. We should limit ‚Äújoint ventures‚Äù with Chinese copycat companies and encourage our allies to do the same. We should prohibit Chinese investment in industrial categories where the Chinese have blocked American investment. And when the Chinese threaten retaliation and bring suit at the World Trade Organization, we should welcome the opportunity to have China publicly repudiate its anti-free trade practices. These measures targeted at China are no less bold than Mr. Trump‚Äôs broad metals tariffs. Indeed, what I propose could do more to redirect trade flows to the United States. The right trade policy for the United States is not a choice of unrestrained free trade or protectionism. ‚ÄúMore Trade‚Äù or ‚ÄúLess Trade‚Äù isn‚Äôt the goal. The goal is better jobs and higher wages for American workers. Trade is a means to those ends. I believe in the promise of free and fair trade, but to defend that principle against an adversary that has broken the rules with impunity, we have to be willing to fight with everything we‚Äôve got ‚Äî not just tariffs.

Business,"Advertisement By KEITH BRADSHERMAY 3, 2018  BEIJING ‚Äî China is struggling to find people in Washington who can provide insight into the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive moves on trade. One senior American trade insider tried to help ‚Äî and wound up in Beijing with little to do but check out the pottery. That insider, Alan Wolff, a veteran senior adviser to the top United States trade representative and a frequent visitor to Beijing, came to China two weeks ago to speak at a conference on agricultural trade and sought to make contact with top Chinese policymakers. But they did not respond to his requests for meetings, and they said days later that they had not known who he was. Mr. Wolff, an admirer of ancient pottery, instead spent a quiet Saturday in a Beijing museum browsing 2,200-year-old bowls. As members of the Trump administration delegation arrived in Beijing on Thursday for two days of high-level talks, they sat across from Chinese officials with limited experience in trade matters. Advertisement After a bureaucratic reshuffling, the members of China‚Äôs new negotiating team have deep backgrounds in economics and finance, but they are less comfortable with the minutiae of trade laws. And although they are familiar with the American delegation‚Äôs main players, they are less acquainted with who does what among lower-level advisers and officials when it comes to United States trade policy. Advertisement Both countries have played down the possibility that the negotiations will resolve the simmering tensions between them. Still, Chinese officials‚Äô lack of experience in international trade law could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a situation where the Ministry of Commerce doesn‚Äôt have all the people in place that it wants to have,‚Äù said James Zimmerman, a former four-time chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, citing the Chinese agency that traditionally handles trade matters. ‚ÄúI really think they are unprepared for the negotiation that is taking place.‚Äù Chinese officials dispute that characterization, saying the reorganization will not hurt a stance that they describe as tough but flexible. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it is a problem, or that this process of organizational reform will affect the ability to negotiate,‚Äù Li Gang, the vice president of the Chinese commerce ministry‚Äôs research and training academy, said in a recent interview. The new team of top Chinese negotiators, few of whom come from the Commerce Ministry, is led by Liu He. Mr. Liu, an economist by training, is a close adviser and longtime friend of President Xi Jinping. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers spoke about economic policy at a three-day Tsinghua University seminar that ended on Monday. Most of them insisted on anonymity for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity. Those attending the seminar said that Chinese negotiators had a warm relationship with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who is a member of the American delegation and a former Goldman Sachs executive. He was described as easy to talk to. Chinese officials said they felt less of a connection to the rest of the group, which includes, among others, Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who was described as brusque by people on the Chinese side; Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime critic of China; Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council; and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary.

[Read about the divisions on the American side of the table during high-level trade talks in Beijing.] Advertisement Many of the negotiators representing the United States are more comfortable than their Chinese counterparts with the fine points of trade policy. Mr. Lighthizer, for example, has been immersed in trade issues continuously since the Carter administration, working closely throughout with Mr. Wolff, and has taken a harder stance. By contrast, after a series of bureaucratic reorganizations in recent months, many of China‚Äôs top trade negotiators are now economists and bankers with little practical experience in trade matters. The Commerce Ministry‚Äôs two main officials for trade talks with the United States, veterans who have negotiated with Washington since the 1990s, were each awarded ambassadorships last year and dispatched to Europe. One senior Chinese official at the seminar who insisted on anonymity said there was deep frustration among his colleagues that, when the two sides talked in the past, American negotiators continually raised details about Chinese trade practices and international trade laws, while those on the Chinese side preferred to discuss a coherent economic strategy. Chinese policymakers are also annoyed about the number of United States agencies involved in the talks. Officials in China are accustomed to dealing with the Treasury, which coordinated American economic policy toward Beijing for nearly two decades. They are less accustomed to dealing with the office of the United States trade representative, which has consistently tilted toward more assertive policies and has a prominent role under President Trump. The senior Chinese official said he missed the old Treasury-led team every day, and Chinese officials have suggested regularly this year that the United States revive that approach. Doing so could allow Treasury to take charge again, even though United States law says the trade agency should be in charge of trade issues. On the Chinese side, the rise of economists and bankers is part of a broad reshuffling meant to consolidate the Communist Party‚Äôs political power. As part of the reorganization, China‚Äôs Commerce Ministry was broken in March into three separate groups each focused on different issues. The ministry‚Äôs office of trade negotiations still exists and has numerous trade lawyers, but people involved with the negotiations say the shuffling has robbed the office of resources and support. But even the trade negotiations office has effectively been sidelined by a Communist Party group led by Mr. Liu. The group, now called the Central Commission on the Economy and Finance, was originally intended to bring the country‚Äôs debt under control. To accomplish that, Mr. Liu, who was educated at Harvard, has hired dozens of economists and bankers, men and women in their 30s and 40s with graduate degrees from the most highly regarded economics departments and business schools in China and the West. What the commission largely lacks are trade lawyers. Chances that the talks would yield major progress appeared slim on Thursday. China‚Äôs official news agency, Xinhua, reiterated Beijing‚Äôs stance that should a trade war break out, the country was better prepared thanks to its centralized leadership, strong domestic consumer base and greater desire to protect the current structure of trade. Advertisement At the seminar over the weekend, Chinese officials also struck a defiant tone. Peng Guangqian, a retired major general who remains an influential military strategist, said, ‚ÄúPresident Trump wants to curb our development.‚Äù Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Letter To the Editor: Re ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs Destructive Trade War‚Äù (editorial, March 4): You warn that a trade war including tariffs on steel imports that President Trump wants imposed might harm workers in American steel-using industries like autos, and you say these tariffs will send the United States into a ‚Äúbroader trade war, the likes of which the world hasn‚Äôt seen since the Great Depression.‚Äù In fact, we have been in trade wars for many years. When China subsidized the investment into enormous excess steel-producing capacity that could be got rid of only by dumping it on world markets, it was in effect declaring a trade war. When China adopted the policy of everything ‚Äúmade in China 2025,‚Äù it was declaring a trade war. When Japan allowed its auto producers to control the auto distributors, it was declaring a trade war. When China said Google and Facebook could not operate in China, it was declaring a trade war, and moreover, also declaring an ideological war. Conventional free-trade wisdom has little to do with reality. CLYDE PRESTOWITZ, KULA, HAWAII The writer was chief United States trade negotiator with Japan in the Reagan administration.

Politics,"Advertisement By PETER BAKER, ANDREW HIGGINS and STEVEN ERLANGERMARCH 30, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Some senior Trump administration officials are pressing for more aggressive action toward Russia, hoping to persuade a reluctant President Trump to change his approach after a week of mass diplomatic expulsions that have driven the relationship with Moscow to its lowest point in decades. With hundreds of diplomats in Washington, Moscow and European capitals packing their bags as the tensions stemming from the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain have worsened, the Trump team is eyeing additional sanctions and other measures against Russia. But while aides say the president has become increasingly convinced that Russia is dangerous, he has still refused to embrace a tougher public posture himself and remains uncertain how far to authorize his administration to go. Mr. Trump has emphasized the importance of dialogue with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, yet the departure of so many diplomats expelled from both Russia and the United States will make it that much harder to maintain a semblance of normal relations between the two countries. Cooperation in areas as varied as agriculture, counterterrorism, military affairs and space exploration could diminish, as could private travel and business dealings. The perils of the diplomatic breakdown came into sharper relief on Friday. Russia‚Äôs ambassador in Washington lamented that no one would meet with him, and his embassy complained that Russian diplomats were being harassed by American intelligence agencies eager to recruit them. Advertisement The Pentagon, for its part, said that it had no notice of a test of a new intercontinental ballistic missile conducted by Russia and announced on Friday, a lack of communication that experts worry could lead to miscalculation. Advertisement ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember such bad shape of our relations,‚Äù Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to Washington, told NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show. ‚ÄúThere is a great mistrust between the United States and Russia.‚Äù Since his arrival last year in Washington, Mr. Antonov said he had invited American officials to his residence only to be repeatedly rebuffed. ‚ÄúIf they are scared, I said, ‚ÄòCome on, we can meet in a restaurant and to discuss all outstanding issues,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was four or five months ago. And I got answer: silent.‚Äù American officials said a shift in the administration‚Äôs approach has been building for weeks. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose last official day on the job is Saturday, had come to the conclusion before Mr. Trump fired him this month that a year of attempting to cooperate had not yielded much success, according to people familiar with his thinking. As a result, they said, Mr. Tillerson had begun mapping out a tougher policy toward Russia and found agreement in the White House. The administration began taking a more robust approach, publicly blaming Russia for a devastating attack on computers in Ukraine and elsewhere, accusing Moscow of trying to break into the United States‚Äô power grid and imposing sanctions in retaliation for Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. Mr. Tillerson‚Äôs feelings were hardened further by a conversation with Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary who described to him the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter living in Britain. Even in the hours before his dismissal by Mr. Trump, Mr. Tillerson spoke out in stronger terms than the president in condemning the poisoning. While Mr. Tillerson is on the way out, his designated successor, Mike Pompeo, and the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, are both considered even more hawkish on Russia. At the same time, some officials at the Pentagon have expressed caution about the escalating conflict with Russia, citing consequences in Syria, where the United States and Russia have both conducted military operations. Advertisement The Trump administration expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle this week as part of a wider international retaliation for the poisoning of Mr. Skripal. Russia responded Thursday by ordering out 60 Americans and closing the consulate in St. Petersburg. The scope of Russia‚Äôs retaliation grew clearer on Friday as the Kremlin summoned 23 ambassadors from other countries to evict some of their diplomats. On Saturday, the Tass news agency reported that Moscow had informed Britain it must send home a total of ‚Äúmore than 50‚Äù diplomats. Russia had already announced the expulsion of 23 Britons. Mr. Trump has remained publicly silent amid the dramatic rounds of diplomatic retaliation, leaving it to others to condemn Moscow. Frustrated by the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether his campaign cooperated with Russia in 2016, a scenario he dismissed as a ‚Äúhoax,‚Äù Mr. Trump recently called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his victory in a re-election widely dismissed as a sham.

Mr. Trump made no mention of the poisoning of Mr. Skripal during the call but instead suggested that he wanted to schedule a summit meeting with the Russian president. Both countries still have ambassadors in place, so high-level contact on potentially calamitous matters should continue, as it did at the height of the Cuban missile crisis. But the wheels of basic diplomacy, involving visas, consular services, cultural events and simply talking to people, are grinding ever more slowly and, in some cases, coming to a halt. ‚ÄúThe parties lose some of their eyes and ears, so the quality of the reporting goes down,‚Äù said Charles A. Kupchan, who was the Europe director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just intelligence but day-to-day political and economic reporting: What‚Äôs the buzz in the street, what do interlocutors say? And consular services do get hit.‚Äù The expulsions left many diplomats wondering how the American Embassy in Moscow could operate. Much of the burden will fall on the ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who took over an embassy already struggling to function after an order by the Kremlin last summer that it dispense with 755 employees in response to sweeping American sanctions for Russia‚Äôs election meddling. ‚ÄúThe embassy is struggling to do basic operations. This latest round will hurt,‚Äù said Michael A. McFaul, who served as ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014. ‚ÄúMorale, of course, is also very low.‚Äù Even before this week‚Äôs expulsions, the wait in Moscow to obtain a visitor‚Äôs visa to the United States was among the longest in the world. It now takes 250 days just to get an appointment with the visa section, compared with four in Beijing and 31 in New Delhi. Advertisement An American spokesman told Russian news media this week that the embassy had been placed under ‚Äúsignificant constraints‚Äù by the Foreign Ministry and ‚Äúcould not accommodate all their many requests at all times, particularly for large groups.‚Äù Simon Schuchat, a former diplomat at the embassy in the Moscow, recalled how haphazard and unnerving it was when Russia began the process of ousting alleged spies during a round of expulsions in 2001. Inevitably, Moscow ordered out diplomats unconnected to espionage. ‚ÄúThey tended to go for people with better language skills,‚Äù Mr. Schuchat said, adding that they ‚Äúmissed many spies and included many non-spies.‚Äù This time around, intelligence officers working under ‚Äúofficial cover‚Äù as diplomats were especially targeted, but some American officials played down the impact, saying the United States still came out ahead in the expulsions. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs to our benefit,‚Äù Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, said at a seminar on Thursday in Austin, Tex. ‚ÄúThere are a lot more Russians in America than Americans in Russia in the intelligence agencies.‚Äù On Friday, Russia‚Äôs Foreign Ministry accused the agencies overseen by Mr. Coats of exploiting the situation by approaching Russian diplomats leaving the United States to offer ‚Äúassistance‚Äù in exchange for ‚Äúentering into covert relations‚Äù on behalf of the American government. ‚ÄúThe ploy is not working,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement, ‚Äúbut their behavior is cynical and distasteful, as if Washington has stepped completely beyond the bounds of common decency.‚Äù Peter Baker reported from Washington, Andrew Higgins from Moscow, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

Business,"Advertisement By PETER S. GOODMANMARCH 10, 2018  LONDON ‚Äî In the more than seven decades since the end of the Second World War, leaders of the planet‚Äôs major economies have operated on a rough consensus that trade offers a potent form of inoculation against the outbreak of military hostilities. The United States and its allies have constructed an economic and security order centered on the notion that communities connected by commerce have a shared interest in maintaining peace. They forged institutions focused on reducing tariffs and other impediments to trade, with the World Trade Organization as the linchpin. But now this collective understanding is under assault by the very power that has championed it most fervently. As President Trump on Thursday delivered steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, provoking vows of retaliation from enraged producers, he risked setting off a global conflict. Though Mr. Trump stepped back from plans to impose tariffs on every nation ‚Äî exempting, for the time being, Canada and Mexico ‚Äî he did so while exerting additional pressure: He emphasized that tariffs could ultimately land on both countries unless they bend to American demands in renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Advertisement In raising the possibility of sparing other allies from the tariffs, Mr. Trump kicked off a fierce scramble for exemptions that has left American trade partners confused and alarmed. He has amplified the sense that the United States has forsaken its role as a leading defender of a global trading system anchored by clear rules of engagement. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe level of tension between the United States and its major trading partners is probably more tense than it has been at any time since the early 1980s,‚Äù said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England. Whether Mr. Trump has begun a trade war or merely a skirmish will depend on what happens next ‚Äî which countries win a reprieve from the tariffs, and which opt to retaliate. Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision to back off from across-the-board tariffs came in the face of strident warnings from the American business world and leaders of his own Republican Party that such a course would damage the American economy and alienate allies. Still, Mr. Trump brushed aside talk that tariffs were a reckless provocation, appearing to relish his role as instigator. ‚ÄúTrade wars are good and easy to win,‚Äù he tweeted this month. Mr. Trump maintains that Americans have been outwitted by savvier trading partners, with tariffs needed to force jobs to return to the United States. History has proved humbling for those inclined to seek victory through trade conflicts. Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions. Many economists and international-relations experts assume that Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs could play out much the same way, isolating the United States while imperiling a global economic expansion. Advertisement Not least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis. The organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game. In justifying its tariffs as a response to a supposed threat to national security ‚Äî a contention that has drawn derision from economists ‚Äî the Trump administration has virtually ensured a challenge from the European Union via a complaint filed with the trade organization. That would put the institution in a predicament in which any course risks undermining its authority. The trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade. ‚ÄúThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,‚Äù said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert. Or the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate. Hostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump‚Äôs pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan. On Wednesday, the European Union outlined plans to retaliate with tariffs on a variety of American goods, including motorcycles, rice and bourbon. If reprisals continued, Europe might limit exports of other American agricultural products, intensifying its push against genetically modified crops. In the most extreme case, Europe might even impede American investment. Advertisement ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,‚Äù said Jennifer A. Hillman, an international trade expert at Georgetown Law Center in Washington.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Faced with a rebuke from the global trading body, Mr. Trump might pull the United States out of the institution. As he addressed a delegation at the trading body‚Äôs Geneva headquarters on Monday, W.T.O.‚Äôs director general, Roberto Azev√™do, worried openly about a descent into a trade war. ‚ÄúIt is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOnce we start down this path, it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.‚Äù Trade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents. ‚ÄúYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,‚Äù said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. ‚ÄúYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.‚Äù Mr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade. ‚ÄúThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,‚Äù Mr. Posen said. ‚ÄúThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.‚Äù That idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong. As the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition. Advertisement The law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods ‚Äî from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression. After Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II. The last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry ‚Äî caught unprepared for the public‚Äôs embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles ‚Äî lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States. Japanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers. Trade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today. Back in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict. Today‚Äôs primary American trade antagonist is China, ruled by the apparent president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose nationalist credo does not leave room for caving to pressure from Washington. The world faces a glut of steel, much of it made in China. Whatever tariffs the Trump administration maintains, foreign steel manufacturers are not likely to construct new plants in the United States. Among proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter. In 2002, President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel to protect American producers against imports. Then, as now, companies that make products using steel vastly outnumbered those that produce the metal. As automakers and other steel buyers confronted higher costs, the tariffs eliminated some 200,000 jobs, according to one study. Advertisement Foreign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down. But if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack. ‚ÄúThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,‚Äù Ms. Crowley said. ‚ÄúIt seems like it‚Äôs not really registering how damaging this could be.‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on March 12, 2018, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Tariffs, and Tough Talk by Trump, Upset a Global Consensus on Trade.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter Baker ST. LOUIS ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs tough response in holding Russia responsible for a poisoning attack on its soil increased the pressure on President Trump to join with a NATO ally in taking action, even as he has been reluctant to retaliate for Moscow‚Äôs intervention in the 2016 election in the United States. Mr. Trump, who was visiting Missouri on Wednesday, has not personally addressed the attack since London assigned blame to Russia and left it instead to aides to express public solidarity with Prime Minister Theresa May after she expelled 23 Russian diplomats, canceled high-level contacts and vowed to impose more sanctions. ‚ÄúThis latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes,‚Äù the White House said in a written statement. ‚ÄúThe United States is working together with our allies and partners to ensure that this kind of abhorrent attack does not happen again.‚Äù But for whatever reason, Mr. Trump avoided saying so personally in public, much as he has generally avoided condemning Russia for its election meddling. He has allowed top advisers to denounce Moscow for its interference in American democracy, but when it comes to his own Twitter posts or comments, he has largely stuck to equivocal language, seemingly reluctant to accept the consensus conclusion of his intelligence agencies and intent on voicing no outrage or criticism of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, for whom he has expressed admiration. Instead, through early evening, Mr. Trump used his Twitter feed to focus on issues like trade, infrastructure, school safety and his complaints that Senate Democrats are obstructing confirmation of his nominees. His only public comments during the day came at a Boeing plant where he talked about tax cuts. Critics of both parties pressed the president to speak out personally and possibly take action to back up Mrs. May. ‚ÄúWhere Prime Minister May has taken bold and decisive initial action to combat Russian aggression, our own president has waffled and demurred,‚Äù said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. ‚ÄúPrime Minister May‚Äôs decision to expel the Russian diplomats is the level of response that many Americans have been craving from our own administration.‚Äù Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said the United States should consult with NATO allies about ‚Äúa collective response,‚Äù including the possibility of expelling Russian diplomats from Washington and other alliance capitals or freezing more Russian assets. ‚ÄúWe ought to make it inescapably clear to Russia that its shadow war will be met with a coordinated response,‚Äù he said. Evelyn Farkas, a former Pentagon official who oversaw Russia policy under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump should offer a range of assistance to Britain to help investigate the episode, prevent further such attacks on British sovereignty and impose punishment. She added that the United States could cite the suspicious death of Mikhail Y. Lesin, a former Russian minister, in a Washington hotel in 2015, in taking joint action. Investigators concluded that he died from a drunken fall but many remain skeptical. ‚ÄúFrankly, I believe we should have and could still do this in response to Russia‚Äôs election interference in the United States and several other NATO countries,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe certainly should craft additional sanctions together with the U.K. and the E.U. to address the assassinations.‚Äù Until Tuesday night, the White House had avoided pointing the finger at Russia for the attack, in which a former Russian spy was poisoned with a nerve agent near his home in southern England. At her briefing on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, condemned the attack without publicly agreeing with Britain‚Äôs assessment that Russia was behind it. The administration‚Äôs only tough comment on Russian involvement until Tuesday came from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but he has since been fired. Mr. Trump and Ms. May then talked by phone on Tuesday night, and the White House issued a statement expressing his solidarity with her. The British readout of the call attributed stronger language to Mr. Trump than his own White House statement did, reporting that during their conversation, ‚ÄúPresident Trump said the U.S. was with the U.K. all the way.‚Äù By Wednesday morning, lower-level American officials joined in backing Britain as it retaliated against Russia. ‚ÄúRussia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,‚Äù Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, said at an emergency Security Council session, calling the poisoning ‚Äúan atrocious crime.‚Äù That did not satisfy those who said the president should show personal leadership. ‚ÄúJudgment day for Donald Trump,‚Äù R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and an under secretary of state under President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúWill he support Britain unequivocally on the nerve agent attack? Back #NATO sanctions? Finally criticize Putin? Act like a leader of the West?‚Äù Mr. Trump has at times grudgingly accepted that Russia meddled in the 2016 election but usually sounds more determined to rebut any suspicions that his campaign colluded with Moscow or that whatever meddling took place helped him win. He has opted against imposing sanctions beyond those already imposed by Mr. Obama despite a new law passed overwhelmingly authorizing further penalties. Asked about the meddling last week, after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, indicted 13 Russians for spreading disinformation and propaganda in a concerted effort to influence the election, Mr. Trump focused on whether it changed the result, and avoided strong words about Moscow. ‚ÄúWell, the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever,‚Äù he said during a news conference with Sweden‚Äôs prime minister. ‚ÄúBut certainly there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals. And I think you have to be really watching very closely. You don‚Äôt want your system of votes to be compromised in any way. And we won‚Äôt allow that to happen.‚Äù Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said on Wednesday that the president took the election meddling seriously and had ordered his administration to take steps to prevent it from happening again. When asked if the president would eventually opt for retaliation in addition to prevention, Mr. Shah implied that Mr. Trump already had, but in secret. ‚ÄúThere are steps that I‚Äôm talking about that we can talk about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThen there are steps that we can‚Äôt talk about publicly but that our adversaries know that we are engaged in.‚Äù   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase and other corporate giants are joining forces to create a new kind of computing system based on the virtual currency network Ethereum. Some 30 companies are set to announce on Tuesday the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which will create a standard version of the Ethereum software that businesses around the world can use to track data and financial contracts. The new organization, a nonprofit, is part of a broader movement to harness the technological concept known as the blockchain, which was introduced to the world by Bitcoin. Blockchains offer a way for unrelated computers and companies to simultaneously collect and store information without relying on a central authority, similar to the way that Wikipedia is written and maintained by a group of writers and editors rather than a single author. The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority. Many big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions. IBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation. The new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology. Other companies like R3 and Chain have also been developing alternative blockchains. ‚ÄúWe are pretty equally spending our time across the different chains,‚Äù said Alex Batlin, the global head of blockchain at Bank of New York Mellon, which is joining the Ethereum alliance. Ethereum was introduced in 2013 by a developer named Vitalik Buterin, then 19, who had previously worked on Bitcoin. Since its official release in 2015, the Ethereum network has been the target of hackers and theft. Yet it has also won a large following among programmers who view it as a new and sophisticated way for groups of people and companies to initiate and track transactions and contracts of all sorts. That has led some companies to bet that Ethereum will win the race to become the standard blockchain for future business operations. ‚ÄúIn every industry that we come across, Ethereum is usually the first platform that people go to,‚Äù said Marley Gray, the principal blockchain architect at Microsoft. The creation of the Ethereum alliance shows a continuing commitment among big companies to making the technology work, in large part because it promises to create much more streamlined databases that require less back-office maintenance. Accenture released a report last month arguing that blockchain technology could save the 10 largest banks $8 billion to $12 billion a year in infrastructure costs ‚Äî or 30 percent of their total costs in that area. Accenture is one of 11 companies on the governing board of the Ethereum alliance. The current Ethereum network has an internal virtual currency known as Ether, the value of which has risen and fallen over the last two years. On Monday, a single Ether was worth around $15, and all the outstanding Ether were worth around $1.3 billion. Ethereum, however, is much more than just a system for tracking currency. It also allows people to write what are known as smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. Two companies could, for instance, create a contract that would automatically send money to one of them if a particular news authority reported that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series or that ‚ÄúLa La Land‚Äù won the Oscar for best picture. (As the latter example shows, what would happen if the authority was wrong is a more difficult question.) Because of its capacity for smart contracts ‚Äî and other complicated computing capacities ‚Äî Ethereum is viewed as more agile and adaptable than Bitcoin. As with Bitcoin, however, anyone can join the Ethereum network and see all the activity on the Ethereum blockchain. The companies working on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance want to create a private version of Ethereum that can be rolled out for specific purposes and be open only to certified participants. Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes. The purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case. The private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose. Many companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance. Some of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world. ‚ÄúEven if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,‚Äù Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said. The work on Ethereum has continued despite an attack on an Ethereum project last year in which a hacker gained control of more than $50 million worth of Ether. Mr. Batlin and others involved in the Ethereum Alliance said the way the Ethereum developers had handled that attack convinced them of the maturity of the technology. Today, Ethereum has a larger community of volunteer developers, and more computers on its network than Bitcoin. And the members of the new alliance ‚Äî which include Banco Santander, BBVA, Credit Suisse, ING, Intel, Thomson Reuters and UBS ‚Äî say the real-world testing of Ethereum makes it stronger than the alternatives. ‚ÄúEthereum has this massive advantage of having the public network that has been tested for two years,‚Äù Mr. Gray, of Microsoft, said.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper A new virtual gold rush is underway. Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal divisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency ‚Äî known as Ethereum ‚Äî has soared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months. Beyond the price spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and technology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as a sort of Bitcoin 2.0. The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been helped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin software should develop. The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and led some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their businesses. Enter Ethereum. Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen. But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts. The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes. All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. ‚ÄúEthereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution ‚Äî the most elegant solution we have seen to date,‚Äù said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft‚Äôs work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together ‚Äî somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system ‚Äî known as an Ether ‚Äî that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, ‚ÄúBlockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting Through the Hype.‚Äù Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress‚Äôs investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry‚Äôs chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. ‚ÄúA lot of the more established players were thinking, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs still an experiment,‚Äô ‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.‚Äù Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain ‚Äî the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source ‚Äî say, The Associated Press ‚Äî the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin‚Äôs team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software‚Äôs development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers ‚Äî or nodes ‚Äî helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin‚Äôs co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. ‚ÄúBitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,‚Äù he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. ‚ÄúBitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,‚Äù Mr. Bonneau said. ‚ÄúIt will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.‚Äù    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement    Scott Cacciola     ON PRO BASKETBALL JUNE 11, 2017  OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî When J. R. Smith arrived for Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals on Friday night, he was surprised by the low-key atmosphere in the Cleveland Cavaliers‚Äô locker room at Quicken Loans Arena. ‚ÄúGuys were laughing, joking and listening to music, just treating it as a normal game,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI kind of liked the aura and what we had going on, so I didn‚Äôt really say anything and just went with it.‚Äù At that late stage, as they dealt with the prospect of being swept by the Golden State Warriors, the Cavaliers were curiously carefree. The odds against them were so long that the pressure had somehow lifted: What did they have to lose? All the Cavaliers could do was go out and play. For Smith, in particular, it was as if school had been let out for summer. Without hesitation, he launched the game‚Äôs first shot ‚Äî a 3-pointer, because what else? ‚Äî and buried it. He kept shooting, and so did the rest of the Cavaliers. What resulted was an emphatic home victory that revived the series ‚Äî and gave the Cavaliers hope as they ready themselves for Game 5 on Monday night at Oracle Arena. Advertisement ‚ÄúAs individuals, everybody plays for something,‚Äù said Smith, who scored 15 points, all on 3-pointers, in Game 4. ‚ÄúFor whatever reason, we bottled it up and were able to put that out there on the court.‚Äù Advertisement The Cavaliers, who trail in the best-of-seven series by three games to one, will need another solid effort from Smith, who has been his normally inconsistent self. It is almost obligatory to point out that Smith has never been known as one of the most dependable players in the N.B.A. But such are the dire circumstances facing the Cavaliers against an awesome opponent: As much as they have leaned on LeBron James and Kyrie Irving to deliver their usual brilliance, the Cavaliers cannot compete without contributions from role players like Smith. ‚ÄúWe talked to him about trying to make plays,‚Äù Coach Tyronn Lue said. ‚ÄúLike, ‚ÄòI need you to shoot the basketball and be a scorer.‚Äô‚Äù Smith had a frustrating regular season. After he fractured his right thumb in December, he missed 36 games. Once he returned, he struggled to find his familiar form, shooting 35.5 percent from the field for the remainder of the season. He had his share of clunkers, including a 4-of-17 effort against the Los Angeles Clippers. But the Cavaliers were hopeful that Smith would round into shape in time for the playoffs. After all, he was a key part of their championship run last season ‚Äî especially against the Warriors in the finals. In the Cavaliers‚Äô four wins during that series, Smith averaged 14 points while shooting 43.5 percent from the floor and 40 percent from 3-point range. In their three losses, he averaged 6 points while shooting 31.6 percent from the floor and 26.7 percent from 3-point range. His importance was difficult to overstate.

It has been much the same tightrope walk for the Cavaliers this time around. Lue actually wants Smith to be more aggressive, even as Smith ‚Äî who has adopted a far more judicious approach since his gluttonous days with the Knicks ‚Äî seeks to find the right balance. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to force anything just for the sake of shooting,‚Äù Smith said. (We swear, he actually used those words.) In the first two games of the finals, Smith shot 1 of 6 from the floor and scored 3 points. The Cavaliers lost by a combined total of 41 points. He was much improved in Game 3, scoring 16 points before Cleveland succumbed to Golden State in a 5-point loss. Advertisement In the immediate wake of that game, a post appeared on Smith‚Äôs Twitter account: ‚ÄúCavs in 7.‚Äù Smith quickly deleted the tweet and claimed that he had been hacked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been known to do certain things and send some pretty crazy tweets in the past,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut obviously, I would know better than that.‚Äù Smith could not elaborate on the hack ‚Äî ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a technology guy like that,‚Äù he said ‚Äî but it was far from the worst message that could have emanated from his account: Confidence in the face of adversity? The nerve! In fact, given Smith‚Äôs spotty record on social media (feel free to hop online and search), the tweet‚Äôs seeming na√Øvet√© was almost charming. None of the 126 teams that have lost the first three games of an N.B.A. playoff series have ever come back to win, let alone done it in the finals against a team the caliber of these Warriors. The Cavaliers are at least still in the running thanks to their stunning victory in Game 4. Smith needed 16 seconds to make his first 3-pointer, which seemed to boost his confidence. Early in the second quarter, with the shot clock winding down, he launched a 3-pointer from a corner of the Cavaliers‚Äô midcourt logo: swish. It was not the deepest 3-pointer he had ever made. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs up there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEver since I was growing up, my dad always told me, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs not a shot you can‚Äôt make when you walk in the gym.‚Äô‚Äù On Monday, Smith will take his mercurial road show to Oracle Arena, where the usual suspects ‚Äî LeBron and Kyrie, Steph and K. D. ‚Äî will slug it out. But in his own way, for better or for worse, Smith could wind up making all the difference.

Sports,"Advertisement By VICTOR MATHERJUNE 8, 2017  With two and a half minutes left in Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals on Wednesday night, Cleveland led by 6 points, 113-107, and had the ball. The Cavs were poised to get right back in the series. Then it all went wrong. A look at the fateful last minutes that took the Warriors to a 3-0 series lead and the brink of the N.B.A. title. 2:33 to go: J.R. Smith, who had made a 3-pointer to give the Cavs their 6-point lead, takes another, a tad off balance, from the baseline with the shot clock at 2. After taking only four 3-pointers in Games 1 and 2, Smith took all 10 of his shots in this game from beyond the arc and made five of them. This one missed. LeBron James got the rebound. The Cavs‚Äô rebounding had been expected to be a strength in the series, and they finished the game with 59 boards, 15 of them offensive. But you‚Äôve got to make the follow-up shots. James got the ball to Love for a layup. He was directly under the basket, but as he jumped the ball flew harmlessly straight into the air. Love made a gesture of puzzlement afterward; perhaps Draymond Green caused him to lose control. Green got the ball and headed the other way. Advertisement 2:19: Perfect transition basketball. Curry drove the lane before the Cavs could get any kind of defensive setup, and scored. Kyle Korver, not known as a defensive player, made a vague and ineffectual flap at him as he sailed by. The Warriors were within 4 points, 113-109. Advertisement 1:52: Kyrie Irving did some fancy dribbling, drove to the basket and took a one-handed driving layup. It was a little off balance, but was still the kind of shot that often goes in. It bounced tantalizingly on the rim for a few seconds, and went out. Irving atoned by diving for the rebound. It was time to get the ball to James, and he got a shot, a fadeaway midrange jumper. It missed too, and Durant rebounded for the Warriors. 1:15: After a timeout, Durant drove by a slow-footed Tristan Thompson and got a short pull-up jumper. No problem. The Warriors had cut it to a 2-point margin, 113-111. Now Cleveland needed a timeout. 52.5 seconds: The Cavs still had the lead and the ball, it was no time to panic. Korver was acquired in January for one reason: To make 3-point shots. He was open. He missed, completing a 2-for-6 night from long range. ‚ÄúMan, got a great look,‚Äù he said after the game. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one I‚Äôll be replaying.‚Äù Durant got another rebound. 45.3: Durant brought the ball down, reached the 3-point line and didn‚Äôt hesitate. James got a late hand in his face, but the 3 went in. When the Warriors acquired Durant last year, some rashly said the 2017 title was already decided. Shots like this one make them look prescient. The Warriors took the lead for first time since the third quarter, 114-113,.              Lebron kicks out to Korver, Durant takes the ball shoots a 3 over Lebron. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/GH59aOzb3Y  26.5: Irving tried another shot. It was not a good one: a step back contested by Klay Thompson. Curry got the rebound. 12.9: Korver fouled Durant and he made two free throws to take the lead to 3 points, 116-113. 12.4: There was still time for the game‚Äôs best player to rescue the Cavs. James needed a 3, and he tried to take one at the baseline. But Andre Iguodala blocked it, and the ball went out of bounds off Cleveland.              Andre Iguodala's block on LeBron is poetic. One season everything goes wrong for you and now you're back to being a hero. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/CMQd77T1Kx  A foul and two Curry free throws out the Warriors up 5 and locked up the game, which had only enough time for Love to miss a 3. The Warriors had outscored the Cavaliers by 11-0, with 7 of those points coming from Durant.

Business,"Advertisement By ERICA BERENSTEINMARCH 24, 2018  The banana wars were spats that escalated, tariff by tariff, into a decades-long dispute between the United States and the European Union. The Trump administration this week raised fears of a trade war after it authorized a series of tariffs explicitly ‚Äî and implicitly ‚Äî aimed at China. Tariffs, and the specter of trade wars, are nothing new. The United States and the European Union spent much of the 1990s fighting over bananas. Threats and tariffs flew back and forth across the Atlantic. What had started with a call for free trade in bananas by Costa Rica, in 1991, escalated into an all-out battle between two of the world‚Äôs economic superpowers. At the time, the so-called banana wars were seen as a test of the sustainability of the newly formed World Trade Organization, as Europe and the United States fought over whether Europe could give preferential treatment to bananas imported from former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific regions.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Dani Rodrik The latest round of North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations came to an end last week without a deal. It‚Äôs not clear whether a compromise will be reached or President Trump will make good on his threat of pulling out. But we have seen enough of his approach to trade to know it is fundamentally mistaken and counterproductive. Mr. Trump is not wrong to think that trade agreements have shortchanged America as a whole while enriching corporate and financial interests. He was right to walk away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that was less about free trade and more about special privileges for investors, large companies and pharmaceutical businesses. But Mr. Trump made a mistake by prioritizing a Nafta renegotiation. The jobs lost to Mexico will almost certainly never come back. Automation ensures that manufacturing employment will continue to be a small percentage of the labor force. Moreover, trade barriers would be disruptive to employment in their own right: United States auto production now relies on extensive North American supply chains in auto parts. Mr. Trump‚Äôs focus on the bilateral trade deficit with Mexico is also a red herring. The overall trade deficit of the United States is determined primarily by macroeconomic factors ‚Äî American consumers‚Äô saving propensities, domestic corporations‚Äô investment behavior and the federal government‚Äôs fiscal and monetary policies. Trade policies with Mexico can do very little to alter this picture. But the biggest flaw of this administration‚Äôs trade policy is that it falls squarely within the pervasive established mercantilist tradition. For mercantilists, the purpose of trade agreements is to open up other countries‚Äô economies to our companies to the maximum extent possible while minimizing how much we open up ours. Everybody else must adjust how their economy works, while we maintain our own ways. Under the guise of fairness to workers as a whole, this approach equates national interest with the profit-seeking behavior of United States corporations or protectionist groups. When trade agreements focused mostly on tariff and non-tariff barriers at the border, mercantilism produced some salutary consequences. Reaching agreement would require the United States to reduce its tariffs in return for other countries reducing theirs. International trade would be freer as a result. But today‚Äôs trade deals are largely about domestic regulations and standards ‚Äî the behind-the-border rules that purportedly stifle international commerce and investment. Mercantilism no longer has much of a silver lining. It now translates simply into investors and corporations getting their wish list fulfilled with the removal of any and all impediments to their cross-border activities. Of all the special interests that have shaped recent trade agreements, none has been as energetic in its lobbying, or more successful, than the pharmaceutical sector. A result has been the inclusion of ever stringent patent rules in trade agreements since the 1990s. Historically, patent laws have been enacted as an inducement to innovation, yet economists are increasingly skeptical that strong patents are necessary for that purpose. Euphemistically called ‚Äútrade-related intellectual property rights,‚Äù these protections serve mainly to transfer monopoly profits from global consumers to patent holders in the United States. Mr. Trump has fully aligned himself with big pharma‚Äôs trade agenda, seeking to raise intellectual property protection in other nations to levels similar to that in the United States. In high-tech and financial services, two other areas where American firms have traditionally lobbied heavily, his objectives mimic those of previous administrations. He wants the reduction or elimination of barriers to United States investment abroad, while domestic restrictions on foreign investment ‚Äî in shipping, for example, and many other areas ostensibly related to national security ‚Äî naturally remain untouched. Mr. Trump does pay lip service to upholding labor and environmental standards, which were shifted to side agreements in the original Nafta negotiations. But he has little interest in domestic policies that would really help those hurt by trade. A truly fairer globalization would start at home, with a reconstruction of the social compact that binds the corporate elite and the wealthy to labor and the middle class. Every society that opens itself up to the world economy needs social transfers, labor-training programs and regional policies that take care of the adversely affected workers and communities. Our domestic approach, over-reliant on underfunded and ineffective trade-adjustment assistance policies, has not worked and needs to be replaced by more extensive safety nets. These must be complemented with more progressive income taxation, employment-generating policies such as infrastructure investment and political reforms that reduce the role of money in politics. Mr. Trump and the Republicans want to take us in exactly the opposite direction, with a tax reform that will benefit the wealthy first and foremost. The problem with Mr. Trump‚Äôs economic nationalism is not his avowed belief that trade should serve the national interest. When we economists teach the theory of trade, we emphasize that free trade is desirable because it expands the domestic economic pie ‚Äî not because it confers gains to other nations. The problem is that he is deeply averse to the domestic policies that would allow American workers a piece of the added pie. International fairness in turn would require us to recognize that all countries have legitimate reasons to value their national sovereignty. Rules for finance or intellectual property that, for good or ill, prevail in the United States will frequently be unsuited to other countries. Our trade policy should not be driven by big banks and pharma companies that show very little concern for such considerations. Mr. Trump‚Äôs failure to distance himself from special-interest globalization is perhaps not surprising. But it exposes the vacuity of his brand of populism. Despite all his talk about fairness and the need to stand up for ordinary working people, he has little to offer his core constituency. He will exacerbate, rather than mend, the grievances that made his presidency possible.

Sports,"Advertisement By BILLY WITZJUNE 13, 2017  OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî As the final seconds began to tick off the clock in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals on Monday night, LeBron James stood under the basket and looked up, oblivious to the action going on behind him. Then, as the finality began to sink in that there would be a new champion, he pivoted and walked purposefully toward the other end of the court, making a beeline for Kevin Durant, a rare equal whom he had spent much of these finals battling. In that moment when they embraced, James might have seen something of himself in Durant, another transcendent talent who had to endure years of frustration, and a change of scenery, before earning the validation that comes with a title. A while later, James acknowledged seeing something else ‚Äî a player in Durant and a team in the Golden State Warriors, who not only buzz-sawed through his Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, clinching their title with a 129-120 victory, but who may not be abdicating any time soon. Advertisement ‚ÄúPretty much all their big-name guys are in their 20s, and they don‚Äôt show any signs of slowing down,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs going to be a lot of teams that are trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if they‚Äôre able to actually face them in a playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference. Because they‚Äôre built for ‚Äî from my eyes ‚Äî they‚Äôre built to last a few years. So we‚Äôll see.‚Äù Advertisement James has taken his teams, in Miami and now Cleveland, to seven consecutive finals. Finally, there may be a team that can outlast him. Durant, the finals‚Äô most valuable player, is 28. Stephen Curry is 29. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green are 27. Only Andre Iguodala, 33, might be considered on the backside of his prime, though he hardly showed it Monday, with 20 points that included a thunderous dunk. The 32-year-old James, with the mileage of 14 seasons on his legs, never slowed down in this series. He became the first player to average a triple-double in the finals, and his 41 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists on Monday were enough to leave him somewhat at peace with the final result. This was not the James of two years ago, when he was still at his locker, a towel draped over his head, 45 minutes after the Warriors beat his injury-diminished Cavaliers in six games in the first of their three consecutive confrontations in the finals. Instead, this time, James could look dispassionately at what happened. He even tried to put it in terms a sportswriter could understand. ‚ÄúIt would be the same if you wrote the best column of your life and somebody picked another one over you,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúHow would you feel? So you wouldn‚Äôt hold your head down, but you would be like, ‚ÄòO.K., it‚Äôs just not my time.‚Äô ‚Äù A year ago, James‚Äôs chase-down and block of Iguodala‚Äôs late layup attempt proved to be the signature play in Cleveland‚Äôs stunning Game 7 win over the Warriors, a victory that capped a comeback from a three-games-to-one deficit. Advertisement But the two indelible moments in these finals were not as favorable to James. In one instance, in Game 1, he was put through the rinse cycle, futilely chasing Curry and whiffing on a block attempt. Then, in Game 3, James stood helplessly as Durant buried a late 3-pointer that essentially gave the Warriors the victory. James has now won only three of his eight trips to the finals, a losing record that doesn‚Äôt align with everything else he has achieved but does point to just how hard it can be to lead a team to a championship. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mentally exhausting,‚Äù said Jerry West, the Golden State executive and the former Los Angeles Lakers star who needed eight trips to the finals before winning his only title. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs players and there‚Äôs players that play the game at a higher level. The expectation for the players that play the game at a higher level is off the charts.‚Äù Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

James has dealt unflinchingly with those expectations season after season. But winning the finals has often proved to be elusive. ‚ÄúYou need a few good bounces, you need good luck, you need to be healthy and you need to have players that can focus every night, not four or five games,‚Äù West said. ‚ÄúAnd then there has to be that incredible will. Sometimes that will wins out.‚Äù For James, it did a year ago. And on Monday night, he tried to push the Cavaliers to come from behind and keep the series going. But Kyrie Irving missed all six of his shots in the fourth quarter after his back and knee stiffened. And the Cavaliers‚Äô defense stumbled, leaving the Warriors with several painfully easy shots. With just under two minutes to play and the Warriors nursing a 126-115 lead, James backed Durant into the lane, pivoted and shot a 14-foot turnaround that rimmed out. Tristan Thompson grabbed the rebound, but he missed, too. The game, and the series, was over. In many ways, it was the intended outcome of the Warriors‚Äô coup last summer, when, still feeling the sting of losing to James in the finals, they lured Durant away from Oklahoma City. Advertisement ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you have to do when you‚Äôre going against LeBron,‚Äù said Cavaliers forward James Jones, who has been with James since he went to Miami and won his first two titles. ‚ÄúYou have to try to stack the deck. I think last year proved that you can never have too many weapons when you‚Äôre trying to compete with him. That‚Äôs the mark of an amazing player ‚Äî he‚Äôll constantly force people to look to try to stack the deck.‚Äù Now, the Warriors have in Durant the next best thing to James ‚Äî as well as a full cast of game-changers and role players who have figured out how to play seamlessly together. If some chastised Durant for leaving Oklahoma City to take an easier route to a title, James was not among them. And late Monday night, he again lauded the Warriors for landing the player who turned out to be the M.V.P. of the finals. As the summer begins, James said he would be back in the gym ‚Äî ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a lifestyle for me,‚Äù he said ‚Äî and begin to consider his future and how the imposing Warriors fit into it. While he reminded everyone that he is not a general manager, he said an upgrading of the Cavaliers‚Äô roster may be in order. ‚ÄúI need to sit down and figure this out,‚Äù James said, as if the ball were squarely in his court.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Mike Vorkunov Kristaps Porzingis and Willy Hernangomez first teamed up in 2013 in Seville, Spain, playing for that city‚Äôs prominent basketball club. They were reunited this past season as Knicks after a year in which they were an ocean apart. And now they are not only teammates, they‚Äôre also close friends who spend a lot of time together off the court and have nearly matching black Mercedes-Benzes. Yet as linked as they have already become, they are more intriguing because of their potential role in the Knicks‚Äô future. They could be pillars of the team as it moves forward ‚Äî two talents in the 7-foot range (actually, Porzingis is 7-foot-3) who were drafted on the same night in 2015 and who, to date, represent Phil Jackson‚Äôs best achievements in his three-plus years as team president. The coming weeks and months will serve as an important period for Porzingis and Hernangomez, and for the Knicks. Tension emerged in April when Porzingis, frustrated with the team‚Äôs continuing struggles, skipped his end-of-season exit meeting with Jackson and General Manager Steve Mills. Now comes the 2017 draft, to be held Thursday, with the Knicks holding the eighth overall pick. Jackson is almost certain to select a guard or a wing player, and has made it clear that he prefers that Carmelo Anthony move on from the Knicks and play for another team next season. But whether the player Jackson drafts pays immediate dividends and whether Anthony ‚Äî who has a no-trade clause ‚Äî finally agrees to go elsewhere are both unknowns. What Jackson does know is that Porzingis, 21, is a multitalented giant who in his two seasons with the Knicks has shown the ability to score from anywhere, block shots and play with flair, while Hernangomez, 22, has emerged in his one season in New York as a tough and surprisingly nimble player near the basket with the ability to grab a lot of rebounds. The hope is that Porzingis will become the go-to player on offense on the Knicks for years to come, and that Hernangomez can become a playmaker out of the post and an asset in the pick-and-roll. For inspiration, he has been fed video of Marc Gasol, a fellow Spaniard and big man and a star with the Memphis Grizzlies. Still, there are real questions about how Porzingis and Hernangomez will fare together on the court despite their abilities. Although the most valuable player in the N.B.A. finals was Kevin Durant, an extremely athletic and versatile 7-footer with, among other things, a deadly perimeter game, the N.B.A. is no longer a league dominated by big men, especially two of them in the same starting lineup. Quickness can be an issue when big men are together. So can defense in a league that now emphasizes three-point shooting. In the 558 minutes that Porzingis and Hernangomez shared the floor this past season, the Knicks allowed 107.8 points per 100 possessions, which is not good. Porzingis sometimes struggled when guarding smaller, faster forwards. Hernangomez had his defensive issues, too. There are other issues to consider as well: the continued presence of another big man, Joakim Noah, whose initial season in New York was derailed by injuries and a doping suspension but who still has a long-term contract with the Knicks; Jackson‚Äôs loyalty to the triangle offense; and the possibility that Porzingis could end up at center, not forward, with Hernangomez perhaps coming off the bench. Porzingis has said he intends to stay in Latvia for much of the summer and play for the national team in the European championships. He hopes to beef up, too. The Knicks have sought to make him stronger, in part to give him more opportunities to score closer to the basket. And eventually, Porzingis and Hernangomez will be together again in training camp for the 2017-18 season. They befriended each other in their first week as teammates in Spain, and their families have also grown close. Porzingis helped Hernangomez settle in in Spain, having arrived there first and inviting him over to his apartment, where Porzingis‚Äôs mother cooked dinner for everyone. And Janis Porzingis, Kristaps‚Äôs brother, is an agent at ASM Sports, the group that represents both Porzingis and Hernangomez. ‚ÄúI think we are a big family,‚Äù Hernangomez said. ‚ÄúThe Porzingises and the Hernangomezes.‚Äù Even when Porzingis and Hernangomez were far apart in the 2015-16 season ‚Äî Porzingis a rookie in New York, Hernangomez playing in Madrid ‚Äî the two kept in constant touch. Reunited last season, they hung out at each other‚Äôs apartments, sometimes slept over on each other‚Äôs couches and purchased those similar cars. They even learned to adjust dinner plans, with Hernangomez preferring to eat out but Porzingis‚Äôs instant fame occasionally making that too difficult a task. On the court, they sometimes speak to each other in Spanish when they want to share instructions without the other team understanding. And sometimes they don‚Äôt need to talk. ‚ÄúWe look at each other and we know we‚Äôre thinking the same thing and stuff like that,‚Äù Porzingis said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really special for us to be here again together.‚Äù Now the Knicks have to decide whether a Porzingis-Hernangomez combination can be a key part of the future and who will play with them, decisions that will begin to be made with Thursday‚Äôs draft.

Technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin APRIL 30, 2018  Good Monday. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre watching: ‚Ä¢ T-Mobile and Sprint have their eye on regulators. ‚Ä¢ HNA is set to drop its pursuit of SkyBridge Capital ‚Ä¢ How close are the U.S. and Europe to a trade war? Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. That would be John Legere, perhaps the most colorful and outspoken chieftain in the wireless industry. (He‚Äôs literally the most colorful, usually clad in his company‚Äôs signature magenta color.) If his company‚Äôs $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint goes through, he‚Äôll also have charted the most unlikely success story in the business. He rose through the ranks of other telecom companies, including AT&T and Global Crossing, though his image was far from what he shows off today. (He looked more traditionally corporate back then. ‚ÄúI was an aspiring young executive with a suit, tie and hair like Michael Douglas,‚Äù he told AdAge earlier this year.) Advertisement His path to fame came soon after he took over as T-Mobile‚Äôs C.E.O. in 2012, and the company embarked on its ‚ÄúUn-carrier‚Äù strategy. Consider T-Mobile‚Äôs position at the time: The year before, the company‚Äôs plan to sell itself to AT&T for $39 billion failed, leaving what was then the U.S.‚Äôs fourth-biggest wireless provider with an uncertain future. All T-Mobile had to show for itself was a multibillion-dollar break-up fee paid by AT&T and a bundle of network airwaves known as spectrum. Advertisement But from that, Mr. Legere sought to change the way U.S. wireless providers did business: ‚Ä¢ Lowering prices ‚Ä¢ Ending some long-term contract requirements ‚Ä¢ Offering unlimited data plans ‚ÄúThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the AT&T merger was blocked,‚Äù the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interview. More on the legacy of Mr. Legere, from my and Cecilia‚Äôs story on the deal: Those policies helped T-Mobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years, with 5 million new customers added last year alone. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint all followed suit, and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen, according to Obama-era regulators. The Un-carrier campaign helped propel T-Mobile ahead of Sprint in 2015. As of Dec. 31., the company had 58.7 million retail subscribers, compared to Sprint‚Äôs 40.9 million. T-Mobile‚Äôs market value also outstripped that of Sprint‚Äôs, contributing to the structure of Sunday‚Äôs deal: Mr. Legere would become C.E.O. of the combined company, which would keep the T-Mobile name. In an ironic twist, completion of the Sprint deal would put T-Mobile ahead of its former suitor, AT&T, in terms of retail subscribers. AT&T had 93.2 million at the end of 2017. But Mr. Moffett said that the very success of Mr. Legere and T-Mobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal, since it proves that regulators‚Äô opposition to the two companies‚Äô effort to merge in 2014 was justified. Mr. Legere is also well-known for his Twitter feed, a stream of posts that ranges from slow-cooker cuisine (Sunday‚Äôs edition, published before the deal was announced, involved Kansas City-style ribs, a sly nod to Sprint‚Äôs hometown) to his indoor cycling. But it also includes frequent taunts of his competitors, with Verizon and AT&T derided as ‚Äúdumb and dumber.‚Äù In 2014, after the collapse of a previous round of merger talks with Sprint, Mr. Legere posted this insult of his off-again, on-again deal partner:              Is Sprint a melting ice cube?‚Ä¶.looks like it to me‚Ä¶.join the cool brand NOW! #T-Mobile #Unleash  When I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday ‚Äî which also involved Marcelo Claure, Sprint‚Äôs C.E.O. ‚Äî Mr. Legere chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre expecting me to remember tweets from 2014?‚Äù he responded. ‚Äî Michael de la Merced Winning over regulators is the top priority for the C.E.O.s of Sprint and T-Mobile. On CNBC this morning, Mr. Legere previewed the pitch he would be making: ‚ÄúThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us really was the flipping point as to this is the time.‚Äù ‚ÄúServices are going to be broadened, prices are going to go down, speeds are going to go up. The 5G capability is going to be beyond anything the United States has seen before. Jobs are going to go up from day one. ‚ÄúIf you liked the competition before, you‚Äôre going to love what‚Äôs coming with this one. ‚Äù Bloomberg reports that Sprint‚Äôs chief executive stands to take home $78 million if the deal is completed. Advertisement T-Mobile agreed to buy Sprint in an all-stock deal, which valued Sprint at $26.5 billion or $6.62 a share. At that deal price, Mr. Claure‚Äôs long-term award of 10 million Sprint shares is worth $66.2 million. Those shares ‚Äúwill fully vest if he‚Äôs terminated within 18 months of the deal‚Äôs completion, or if his responsibilities change materially.‚Äù He also ‚Äúis eligible for cash severance of about $11.6 million and $54,000 of other benefits.‚Äù So far this year, companies and other buyers have announced $1.68 trillion of acquisitions, according to Dealogic. That‚Äôs the biggest total through the first four months of a year on record, topping the $1.64 trillion of deals struck in 2007. Merger activity is also on a record pace in the United States. Acquirers have struck $674 billion of deals for U.S. companies through April 30, the highest level on record and exceeding the $607 billion agreed to through the same period in 2007. Yesterday‚Äôs rollout of T-Mobile‚Äôs $26.5 billion bid to buy Sprint ‚Äî the companies‚Äô latest merger effort over the years ‚Äî showed that both wireless carriers are laser-focused on winning over regulators. Their main talking points: Together they can build a robust 5G wireless network, keep prices low for consumers, and create jobs ‚Äî particularly in rural areas. And the wireless market won‚Äôt be a three-company business, with Comcast and others trying to break in. Whether they will succeed is another matter. Michael and Cecilia Kang point out that while the F.C.C. commissioner, Ajit Pai, has signaled an open mind toward mergers, many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014. A preview of Andrew‚Äôs column on the deal, which will go up this afternoon: No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and T-Mobile expend, it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulators. ‚ÄúIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes,‚Äù said Michael Kades, a former lawyer at the F.T.C. who is now the director of markets and competition policy for Washington Center for Equitable Growth. ‚ÄúBut the market concentration is presumptively anticompetitive.‚Äù More on the T-Mobile-Sprint deal: SoftBank‚Äôs Masayoshi Son, who controls Sprint, finally gets the merger he has long craved, but walking away from talks last year cost him dearly. Customers shouldn‚Äôt expect their phone bills to go up ‚Äî at least, not right away. Critics‚Äô corner: The proposed transaction carefully targeted everything President Trump likes, according to Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews. If the deal fails, T-Mobile has a bright future, but Sprint doesn‚Äôt, Tara Lachapelle of Gadfly writes. Banks and credit card companies are reportedly looking at how to identify gun transactions in their payment systems, the WSJ reported on Monday Advertisement From AnnaMaria Andriotis, Telis Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJ: The financial companies have explored creating a new credit-card code for firearms dealers, similar to how they code restaurants, or department stores, according to people familiar with the matter. Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying, some of the people said. The first of those sounds similar to what Andrew called for in a column last month: If the credit card companies and banks agreed, they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù policy ‚Äî like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dick‚Äôs follow ‚Äî and the ones that don‚Äôt. It would add transparency to the process, and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate with. But such a move might concern opponents of gun control, who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the government‚Äôs hands-off approach to monitoring such transactions. And then there are general privacy concerns: Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown, told the WSJ: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the slippery slope danger if it‚Äôs guns today maybe it is pornography tomorrow and the day after it‚Äôs right-wing literature.‚Äù ‚Äî Michael de la Merced The Chinese conglomerate plans to end its bid for SkyBridge Capital, the investment firm founded by Anthony Scaramucci, The WSJ reports. The two firms might strike a partnership agreement instead, The WSJ reports, citing people familiar with the matter. Mr. Scaramucci announced in January 2017 that he was selling SkyBridge to a consortium led by RON Transatlantic and HNA Capital of China. The move came as Mr. Scaramucci was pursuing a position with the Trump administration. Terms of the deal were not announced, but reports at the time pegged its value at around $200 million. The transaction, if it is called off, will be the latest to fall apart under scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. Those deals include Broadcom‚Äôs pursuit of Qualcomm, Ant Financial‚Äôs purchase of MoneyGram, and Canyon Bridge Capital‚Äôs acquisition of Lattice. The country says it will refuse to discuss President Trump‚Äôs two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks. Keith Bradsher of the NYT reports: The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America‚Äôs $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing‚Äôs $300 billion plan to bankroll the country‚Äôs industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft. What‚Äôs behind China‚Äôs stance? Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States. Jan Koum, who sold the messaging app WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion and became a board member of the social network, said he was leaving the company. The reason? Mr. Koum had grown increasingly concerned over Facebook‚Äôs position on user data in recent years, The NYT‚Äôs Sheera Frenkel reports, citing a company executive, who asked not to be identified because the details of Mr. Koum‚Äôs departure were confidential.

Mr. Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp and had insisted that strong encryption be built into the service, was perturbed by the amount of data that Facebook collected on people and had advocated for stronger protections of that information, the executive said.

The gathering reliably draws leaders from Wall Street, Hollywood and sports to Los Angeles to discuss trade, health care, investing and more. This year‚Äôs conference will touch on hot topics like the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the #MeToo movement, the planned talks with North Korea, and the backlash against Silicon Valley. Attendees include Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Tim Sloan of Wells Fargo, Leon Black of Apollo Global Management and Eric Schmidt of Google. Among today's sessions are a survey of the markets that includes Mike Corbat of Citigroup, and a broad discussion of global affairs that includes David Solomon of Goldman Sachs. Make sure to check DealBook for highlights. Come 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, temporary exemptions expire for President Trump‚Äôs imported steel tariffs. That includes the E.U., Canada and Brazil. And for the E.U. in particular, no further extension means that the political bloc ‚Äúshould be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules.‚Äù (Which sounds a lot like a trade war.) Axios reports that key Trump economic officials are split on what to do: Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow want to provide extensions to give negotiations more time, while hard-liners like Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser, are opposed to such a move. Just in case, industrial companies are stocking up on steel and aluminum.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters OSLO ‚Äî Norway's state-owned grid operator Statnett is convinced blockchain technology can improve efficiency in the energy sector but there is a lack of specialist staff, its research and development director Sonja Berlijn told Reuters. Blockchain provides a secure platform for consumers to buy and sell directly from each other and is being explored by several European utilities which say it could revolutionise the energy sector. Implementing blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in the electricity system will reduce daily power consumption peaks and distribute utilisation across the day, possibly curbing the length of any consequent demand-related price spikes, said Berlijn. ""As a consumer you can benefit from these technologies... It could possibly reduce the price fluctuations for consumers. That is the aim, we can hope for that,"" she said. Many prominent European utilities, including Italy's Enel, Germany's and Sweden's Vattenfall, are looking to use the technology, with Britain's Centrica launching a market trial later this year. The problem is that the global electricity sector lacks engineers with expertise to build blockchain systems and applications but, together with artificial intelligence (AI), it will be the future of electricity systems, Berlijn told Reuters. ""Blockchain technology will be able to reduce the day's power consumption peaks by 20 percent,"" she said. Statnett wants to hire roughly 100 specialist staff capable of managing blockchain and AI engineering functions and will fund a professorship role in 2019 so a degree can be offered at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, she added. ""Traditionally we have electrical and mechanical engineers. We see a lack of supply with blockchain and digitisation knowledge. We need to build it,"" said Berlijn, herself Norway's first professor of digital electrical power systems. Currently, the company has about ten employees working with AI, but none of their engineers has blockchain specialisation. Applying the technology in the power system will mostly occur via peer-to-peer trading, by which households and firms can trade unused electricity and regulate their consumption better during the day, using AI-modified electronics. Even though blockchain and artificial intelligence are hard to comprehend for most electricity consumers, understanding them will not be needed or expected, Berlijn said. ""The household electronics will have separate IPs, there will be algorithms that will reduce their consumption. And it will be done automatically in the future via applications,"" she said.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Veronique de Rugy Ms. de Rugy is a senior research fellow at George Mason‚Äôs Mercatus Center. President Trump recently tweeted, referring to the United States trade deficit with China, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre already $500 billion down, you can‚Äôt lose!‚Äù In 1776, Adam Smith observed that nothing ‚Äúcan be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade.‚Äù Sadly, almost 250 years later, the president ‚Äî along with his economic adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ‚Äî has elevated this economic fallacy into a pretext for protectionism. Fueling this bipartisan hysteria is the widespread failure to understand that United States trade deficits generally add capital to our economy ‚Äî more factories, more R & D or more machines. Further confusing the American people, the power held by those advisers means that we hear them on television daily repeating, contrary to almost every reputable economist, their mistaken belief that our $800 billion trade deficit ‚Äî including a $375 billion goods deficit with China ‚Äî reduces our gross domestic product and is evidence of foreign-government chicanery. The notion that trade deficits are always bad for the economy is based on several fundamental mistakes. The first mistake is the assumption that trade is a zero-sum game, suggesting that the country selling products abroad is a winner while the one who buys is a loser. That‚Äôs simply wrong. Think about your own experience. Without ever worrying about it, we run up trade deficits on a daily basis with many merchants. When you shop at the grocery store, enjoy a drink at your favorite bar or get your hair cut, you run up a personal trade deficit with your grocer, bar and hair stylist. Do they ever buy anything from you in return? When you get paid by your employer, he runs up his trade deficit with you. Do you buy as much from your employer as he buys from you? These examples illustrate how trade deficits with other economic entities are almost always nothing to fret about. They‚Äôre unavoidable consequences of the specialization and trade on which our modern prosperity depends. To be sure, on rare occasions trade deficits are symptoms of underlying dysfunctions, but they are never themselves a cause of these dysfunctions. Even if we were to ignore the counsel of nearly every economist and blindly accept the notion that a United States trade deficit with the rest of the planet is undesirable, it would still be completely untrue that a deficit with any single country is undesirable. In this world of nearly 200 countries, bilateral trade deficits are as unavoidable and as economically meaningless as your trade deficit with your grocer. If America‚Äôs overall trade deficit were balanced, we‚Äôd still have deficits with some countries and surpluses with others. More generally, we mustn‚Äôt forget that the American dollars we spend on imports eventually return to America, either by foreigners purchasing American exports or making investments. Protectionists like Mr. Trump always complain about the United States‚Äô trade deficit for goods but mention neither the surplus of foreign investment capital that we get nor our trade surplus in services. Here‚Äôs how it works: The American dollars we use to buy imports are of little use to foreigners outside our borders. They are, however, of great use to foreigners who want to invest within the United States. And that‚Äôs what happens with the dollars that aren‚Äôt spent on American exports. Foreign investment is key to our economic growth here at home. In other words, we Americans win when we get to buy the stuff we want from abroad and when those dollars are pumped back into our economy. This benefit remains intact despite Beijing‚Äôs many violations of our trade rules ‚Äî such as its subsidization of Chinese steel makers. It‚Äôs true that those subsidies artificially lower the price of steel imported by America and might hurt some American steel mills and workers. But this effect is the same as it would be if Chinese steel makers had a genuine efficiency advantage over our producers. Despite the administration‚Äôs constant refrain about the devastating impact of foreign export subsidies on the steel industry, experts know that a vastly greater number of steel jobs were lost to innovation, not trade. Even in the subsidization scenario, we pay for Chinese steel with dollars, and the Chinese then use some of those dollars to buy our exports and use the rest to invest in our country. In both cases, it creates jobs here. The same relationship holds when the Chinese manipulate their currency to stimulate their exports. Some worry that the Chinese won‚Äôt spend their dollars in the United States, but this concern is misplaced. If there were no foreigners who wanted to spend or invest dollars in America, the Chinese would not have exported steel to the United States to begin with. At the end of the day, dollars have value only because they can ultimately be used to buy American-made outputs or be invested in American assets. If the Chinese spend their dollars in Japan, the Japanese will turn around and spend their dollars in America, by investing in such things as a brand-new Toyota plant that will employ United States workers. Dollars will always find their way home. Another way these dollars make their way back home is through foreign investors who buy Uncle Sam‚Äôs debt. As of January 2018, for instance, China has returned $1.17 trillion this way. Overall, about $6.3 trillion of our $15 trillion in public debt is held by foreigners. President Trump argues that yet another reason to eliminate the trade deficit is because it fuels our debt. Nonsense. The only reason we have so much debt is because our government spends more than it collects in taxes. That‚Äôs not the fault of foreigners. We could reduce our trade deficit by reducing our government‚Äôs dependence on borrowing, but that requires a discipline that no one seems to have. Until that changes, foreigners help us shoulder the burden of our irresponsible debt. In fact, we should hope that they don‚Äôt ever change their minds about buying our debt, because the resulting higher interest rates would lead to even bigger budget deficits and even higher taxes on everyone. President Trump should be careful what he wishes for. His attempt to reduce the trade deficit with tariffs will lead not only to fewer imports but also to fewer exports, as economists have long understood. Recessions, reduced foreign investment in the United States and a weak dollar are the most effective ways to reduce the trade deficit. I doubt any of us would enjoy these remedies, which result in slower economic growth, less innovation and lower living standards. Maybe that‚Äôs why few seem to notice or actually care that the trade deficit has been growing under this president ‚Äî to its highest level in nearly a decade.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board Even without the widening scandal over election interference, President Trump would have had a hard time managing America‚Äôs relations with Russia, which are as tense as at any time since the end of the Cold War. The complex differences between the two countries will not be easily resolved. Moreover, President Vladimir Putin has shown a ruthless commitment to self-preservation that relies heavily on returning Russia to a mythical place of power and glory, not in helping the West build a more stable world. Mr. Trump is making sound policy making even harder, though, with his admiration of Mr. Putin and his willingness to surrender the country‚Äôs international leadership, which was on display during the Group of 20 meeting in Germany. Mr. Trump is noticeably more comfortable with Mr. Putin than he is with most of America‚Äôs democratic allies, despite Mr. Putin‚Äôs record of crushing domestic opponents, invading Ukraine and bombing civilians in Syria. There is nothing wrong with Mr. Trump‚Äôs ambition to improve relations with Moscow, given Russia‚Äôs importance as a nuclear weapons superpower with a United Nations Security Council veto. But that does not mean it is wise to underestimate, as Mr. Trump seems to do, the threat posed by Mr. Putin‚Äôs efforts to weaken NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance, subvert democratic procedures and institutions in Europe and America, wage cyberwarfare, destabilize Ukraine and secure influence in Syria. Some Trump administration officials recognize those hazards; Mr. Trump does not. One example is the mixed signals he is sending about maintaining sanctions on Russia. On Air Force One to Paris on Wednesday, he told reporters, ‚ÄúI would not and have never even thought about taking them off.‚Äù Yet in the next breath, he confirmed that he discussed the issue briefly with Mr. Putin and left open the door to easing sanctions as part of a deal over Ukraine or Syria. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent a stronger message in Kiev last week when he assured Ukraine‚Äôs leader that sanctions won‚Äôt be lifted until Russia restores Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúterritorial integrity.‚Äù The problem: Mr. Trump has overruled Mr. Tillerson before. Last month, concerned about Mr. Trump‚Äôs possible capitulation, the Senate approved, 98 to 2, legislation that would impose tough new sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 election and allow Congress to block the president from lifting any sanctions in the future, including those relating to Ukraine. The bill has been stymied by partisan wrangling in the House, and the White House has tried to weaken it. Ordinarily, a president should have flexibility to lift or tighten sanctions, but Mr. Trump‚Äôs intentions are so suspect that this bill has become a necessity. With Russia‚Äôs oil-dependent economy in trouble, Mr. Putin wants all sanctions lifted now. His aides are also pressing Washington to return two diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized as part of the Obama administration‚Äôs response to the election meddling and were reportedly used for spying. But there is no reason to entertain these requests until Mr. Putin has pledged not to interfere in future American elections. Mr. Trump also seemed far too solicitous in agreeing with Mr. Putin to create a joint working group on cybersecurity, an offer Mr. Trump withdrew after an avalanche of bipartisan criticism. The bottom line is that Mr. Trump‚Äôs obsequiousness has yielded few results. Russia is still occupying Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and is intensifying the war in the east against Ukrainian government forces, despite promising in the 2015 Minsk agreement to halt the fighting. Nor has Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Putin to increase economic pressure on North Korea, whose nuclear program is now dominating the administration‚Äôs foreign policy; to stop the dangerous face-offs with American warplanes over the Baltic Sea; or to come back into compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement of 1987 by withdrawing the deployment of a banned missile. There are some hopeful signs, including a limited cease-fire in southwestern Syria. And the administration appointed a well-regarded former American ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, who is known for tough views on Russia, as special envoy to work with Russia on Ukraine. But on a wide range of issues, Mr. Putin seems unwilling to cooperate, and Mr. Trump doesn‚Äôt much seem to care.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board The West‚Äôs response to Russian aggression has usually been too little, too late, and devoid of the one voice that really matters ‚Äî President Trump‚Äôs. But at last, his administration is taking action, and Mr. Trump has spoken out, tentatively. On Thursday the Treasury Department announced it was imposing sanctions for the Kremlin‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. Officials have denounced the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain and Russia‚Äôs devastating bombing missions in Syria. While such steps are encouraging, only a more robust, unified response from the United States and its NATO allies would impede President Vladimir Putin from expanding his pattern of heinous behavior. Before leaving office, President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, seized two diplomatic properties and imposed sanctions in response to the election interference. Mr. Trump, for reasons that have never been made completely clear, has until now resisted a congressional mandate that he expand the penalties. This was despite the warnings of intelligence agencies that Russia is already trying to meddle in the 2018 election and Congress‚Äôs near unanimous passage of the law demanding more sanctions. The sanctions announced on Thursday affect five Russian organizations and 19 individuals cited for spreading disinformation and propaganda to disrupt the election. While this was Mr. Trump‚Äôs most significant anti-Russia move, these are the same entities identified by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling, in a recent indictment and only add two new senior Russian officials, with ties to military intelligence, to the list Mr. Obama sanctioned in 2016, according to Representative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. The penalties need to go further, subjecting Mr. Putin‚Äôs wealthy cronies and their families to sanctions like travel bans and asset freezes that would put even more pressure on the Russian leader. The administration also took the unusual step of citing the Russian government for a previously unconfirmed series of intrusions into American power plants and the computer networks that control power grids that occurred about the time of the election. Those attacks suggest Russian state-sponsored hackers have been actively mapping out Western industrial, power and nuclear facilities for eventual sabotage, experts say. While Mr. Trump said nothing on Thursday about either the sanctions or Russia‚Äôs interference in the election, he did end days of silence about the attack with a military-grade nerve agent against the former spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, despite Moscow‚Äôs denials. ‚ÄúIt certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,‚Äù he told reporters in the Oval Office. ‚ÄúSomething that should never ever happen. We‚Äôre taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.‚Äù But Mr. Trump‚Äôs comments came a full day after his United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, took the lead with a more powerful statement at the Security Council. She insisted the United States stands in ‚Äúabsolute solidarity‚Äù with Britain after the attack. Russia‚Äôs use of chemical weapons on the soil of another United Nations member is a ‚Äúdefining moment,‚Äù she said, and there is a need to ‚Äúhold Russia accountable.‚Äù And the piling on didn‚Äôt stop there. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, whom Mr. Trump reportedly may fire, condemned Russia in a speech on Thursday for being ‚Äúcomplicit in Assad‚Äôs atrocities‚Äù in Syria and conducting more than 100 bombing missions in Eastern Ghouta, as well as being ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù for the Skripal poisoning. All of this occurred after Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to expel 23 Russian spies and suspend high-level contact with Moscow, and also joined the United States, France and Germany in a statement denouncing Russia‚Äôs action as a clear violation of international law. But the statement said nothing about joint action, and Mrs. May‚Äôs measures either lacked details or didn‚Äôt go far enough. Mr. Putin, an authoritarian leader who is expected to be re-elected easily to another six-year term on Sunday, has paid little or no price for his aggressions, including annexing Crimea, destabilizing other parts of Ukraine and enabling President Bashar al-Assad‚Äôs regime in Syria. He won‚Äôt stop until he knows that the United States will stand up to him and work with its allies to impose stronger financial and diplomatic measures to rein him in.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Common Sense By James B. Stewart With President Trump ordering steep new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, and with America‚Äôs trading partners threatening to retaliate, it looks as if Mr. Trump will get the trade war that he seems to want and that he thinks will be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù for the United States to win. ‚ÄúTrade wars aren‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù he had said at the White House on Wednesday. Which made me wonder: What trade wars does Mr. Trump have in mind? The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America‚Äôs trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934. Historians and economists continue to debate the extent of the damage to the global economy, but there is little disagreement that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing trade war exacerbated and prolonged the hardships of the Great Depression. Many historians contend it also contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties. There is almost universal agreement that no one ‚Äúwon‚Äù that trade war. Smoot-Hawley ‚Äúwas such a disaster that it‚Äôs held sway over American trade policy for over 80 years,‚Äù said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also teaches international trade law at Johns Hopkins University. ‚ÄúNo one wants to repeat it.‚Äù He called Mr. Trump‚Äôs comments on trade wars ‚Äúa dramatic departure‚Äù from economic orthodoxy. On the question of who wins, ‚Äúthe easy answer is to say that no one wins a trade war,‚Äù said Marc-William Palen, a professor of history at the University of Exeter in Britain and the author of ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòConspiracy‚Äô of Free Trade,‚Äù which examines trade rivalry between the United States and the British Empire in the 19th century. ‚ÄúBut the more I reflect on it, it seems the winners are those nations that don‚Äôt take part.‚Äù Professor Palen cited the late-19th-century trade wars between Canada and the United States, which caused a precipitous drop in Canadian exports to America and led Canada to seek export markets in Britain. ‚ÄúThe British Empire was the winner,‚Äù he said. Another ‚Äúbig winner‚Äù from a trade war it was not involved in, Professor Palen said, was Soviet Russia, which was largely shunned by Western trading partners after the 1917 revolution and the rise of communism, and was desperate for hard currency. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Professor Palen said, caused countries like Italy to abandon American imports and resume trading with the Soviets, forging trade links that persist today. A textbook case of one country‚Äôs ‚Äúwinning‚Äù a trade war occurred during the late 19th century when a newly unified Italy imposed steep tariffs on imports from France in order to spur domestic industrialization. France, which was much richer and stronger, retaliated with tariffs against Italy, and Italian exports to France collapsed. Even after Italy abandoned its tariffs, France continued to punish Italy for years with high tariffs. ‚ÄúFrance won in the sense that the trade war was brutal for the Italians,‚Äù said John Conybeare, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Iowa, and the author of the book ‚ÄúTrade Wars.‚Äù Professor Conybeare said an enduring lesson from that trade conflict was that if there is a wide disparity in economic strength between two countries, the stronger country will probably prevail. ‚ÄúTrump must be thinking that the large size of the U.S. domestic market gives it a lot of bargaining power in any trade dispute,‚Äù he said. While that may be true with much smaller, weaker countries, it is not the case with trading partners of equal or even larger size, such as the European Union and China. ‚ÄúWithout that large disparity in economic strength, both sides lose,‚Äù Professor Conybeare said. He cited what have become known as the ‚Äúchicken wars‚Äù of the early 1960s, a trade dispute set off when Germany and France imposed tariffs on American chicken. The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States ‚Äúlost‚Äù the war. The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available. There were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy. Much the same can be said of the United States steel industry, which since World War II has probably received more protection from tariffs and quotas than any other industry. ‚ÄúThey just used the protection to raise prices, fatten profits, pay their executives more and avoid automating and reducing costs,‚Äù Professor Conybeare said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt use the breathing space they gained to modernize. So much of the U.S. steel industry is using obsolete technology, which is why they can‚Äôt compete.‚Äù Decades of tariff protection have done little to stem the industry‚Äôs decline. Domestic steel employment dropped from 135,000 in 2000 to 83,600 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Much like Mr. Trump, President George W. Bush veered from Republican free trade orthodoxy in 2002 when he imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain steel products to counter what he claimed was a surge of imports (Canada, Mexico and a number of developing countries were exempted). Although the tariffs were loudly condemned by many Republicans, politicians from steel-producing states supported the move and protectionist Democrats like Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued that the measures did not go far enough. The European Union filed charges with the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were illegal and discriminatory and authorized up to $2 billion in retaliatory measures. The E.U. threatened tariffs on a variety of American products, including autos and Florida oranges. Mr. Bush abandoned the tariffs in December 2003. He claimed that they had served their purpose, but subsequent studies suggested that they had little impact on employment in the industry and led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries that use steel as a raw material. Mr. Trump‚Äôs pronouncements on trade this week ‚Äúsound like a very archaic, 19th-century argument,‚Äù Professor Palen said, referring to a time when protectionism was Republican orthodoxy and Representative William McKinley of Ohio, who later became president, was successfully promoting his Tariff Act of 1890, which raised the average duty on imports to nearly 50 percent. The act is widely considered by historians to have been a disaster that led to higher consumer prices and inflation and provoked a voter backlash. Republicans lost their House majority in 1890 and lost the White House and both houses of Congress in 1892. The act was repealed in 1894. In any trade war, as that example suggests, ‚Äúthe big losers are consumers, who are the vast majority of people,‚Äù Professor Palen said. ‚ÄúA few industries may benefit, but there are way more losers than winners. And the poor are the biggest losers of all. People like Trump may not care that much about paying a few extra dollars. But a lot of people don‚Äôt have that luxury.‚Äù    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business! The Facts This requires context. Mr. Trump is questioning why Lisa Page and James A.

Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSMAY 3, 2018, 9:22 P.M. E.D.T.  JAKARTA ‚Äî  Indonesia, like other emerging markets, has historically struggled to keep accurate records due to a lack of expertise and resources, but the public and private sectors are now looking at blockchain technology to overcome some of these challenges. Blockchain, the digital data structure best known for underpinning cryptocurrencies, provides a shared record of information maintained and updated by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. This approach to data management could help Southeast Asia's largest economy, which has difficulties keeping accurate data and control over everything from food output to personal information for its 250 million people across 17,000 islands. The tax system is one such area and tech firm Online Pajak has launched a blockchain-driven app that allows customers to share encrypted tax data with institutions such as the tax and treasury offices, banks and the central bank. Advertisement As well as increasing transparency and reducing paperwork and errors, it would mean tax payers can know for sure they have paid their dues, said Online Pajak founder Charles Guinot. Advertisement ""Today in Indonesia, there's no proof you've paid,"" Guinot said at a briefing to launch the product last week. The blockchain verification process could also help address doubts that hang over elections in countries like Indonesia. Horizon State, an Australian firm, plans to launch a phone app on Sumatra island in July, which would enable direct polling on various local policy issues. Nimo Naamani, the firm's co-founder, said the system uses blockchain verification and could reduce voting fraud and address the electoral challenges faced by countries with large populations dispersed across remote towns and islands with poor access. Indonesian banks are also looking at the technology: a survey by Bain & Company published last year found about 80 percent of executives at Ô¨Ånancial institutions think blockchain will signiÔ¨Åcantly impact markets. A similar percentage expects to start using it before 2020.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Rico Usthavia Frans, director of digital banking and technology at Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's second-biggest bank by assets, said it was looking at applying blockchain for trade financing, but lenders were waiting for guidelines from regulators. The Financial Services Authority has a dedicated team to study how blockchain could help the industry, said Fithri Hadi, the regulator's director of finance innovation. Crucially, policymakers see the potential to reduce graft in Indonesia's public programes. Farm subsidies, for example, are allocated in the state budget based on the previous year‚Äôs harvest, though such harvest production statements are difficult to verify due to the large numbers of small farmers. This increases the risk of such estimates being overstated in order to receive more funds. Advertisement The government is looking at how it can use the technology directly to authenticate information from fund recipients. ""We want to use the technology platform to be able to identify those groups of people who need to get the benefit,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawat told Reuters, noting her staff are looking at ways to use blockchain for tasks such as subsidy disbursement to micro-loan programes. Blockchain has gained traction in other emerging markets, such as Estonia, which has employed it for a number of services since 2012. Applications include national health, judicial, legislation, security and commercial code systems. However, Iwan Djuniardi, the tax office's director of transformational technology, cautions the pace of adoption in Indonesia could be slower. ""It takes time to process a management change before we adopt a new technology. Even cloud technology is still being debated, let alone blockchain,"" Djuniardi said.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by The Shift By Kevin Roose The room was full of stressed-out cryptocurrency traders. And for once, they weren‚Äôt nervous about the price of Bitcoin, or the roller coaster swings of the virtual currency markets. No, the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes. Specifically, how ‚Äî and whether ‚Äî to pay them. With this year‚Äôs April 17 tax filing deadline fast approaching, many virtual currency traders are sweating over their tax returns. They‚Äôre confused by the complicated rules, many of them stemming from guidelines issued by the I.R.S. in 2014, governing the taxation of virtual currencies. They‚Äôre afraid that the windfall profits created by last year‚Äôs cryptocurrency boom, which sent currencies like Bitcoin and Ether skyrocketing and created a new class of crypto-millionaires, have left them with huge tax bills. And, of course, they‚Äôre worried about drawing the eye of the Internal Revenue Service. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost sleep over it,‚Äù said Shaun, a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last year‚Äôs cryptocurrency profits on his taxes.

This gathering, which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics, a research and education company, featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation.

Mr. Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades, and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysis. ‚ÄúNobody knows what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù said Jeanne Lowdermilk, a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies. ‚ÄúBut the I.R.S. is the one agency you don‚Äôt want to mess with.‚Äù Taxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans. On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading, some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations, including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into ‚Äúprivacy coins,‚Äù such as Monero, which are designed to be opaque and untraceable. They argue about whether the I.R.S. could use the blockchain, the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions, to identify tax evaders in the future. And they ask for tax advice on complex situations, such as fly-by-night cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly, erasing the records of users‚Äô transactions. Cryptocurrencies are tax-unfriendly by design. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technology‚Äôs stateless, decentralized nature. And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, it‚Äôs possible for users to conceal their identities. Until recently, the I.R.S. showed little desire to go after cryptocurrency income, since there was so little of it. But last year‚Äôs boom changed all that. The agency has formed a team of specialists to investigate cryptocurrency-related crimes, including international money laundering and tax evasion. In November, after a yearlong lawsuit, the agency won a judgment that forced Coinbase, the largest American-based cryptocurrency exchange, to turn over account records for more than 14,000 customers. In January, Coinbase sent 1099-K forms to a number of its current users, informing them that their trading proceeds were being reported to the I.R.S. and reminding them to pay the taxes they owed. All of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble. Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves, and they are more likely than your average C.P.A. to understand concepts like airdrops, hard forks and other bits of confusing crypto-jargon. Mario Costanz, the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax, told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year. Last year, Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division, Crypto Tax Prep, which already has several thousand clients and is the fastest-growing segment of his business. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season,‚Äù Mr. Costanz said. Laura Walter, a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter, said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this year. ‚ÄúA lot of crypto investors are younger and don‚Äôt have a lot of experience trading stocks,‚Äù she said. When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, ‚Äúa lot of people are kind of shocked.‚Äù Part of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee ‚Äî you‚Äôre creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for. Complicating matters even more, the timing of last year‚Äôs cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year‚Äôs market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year‚Äôs gains. Ms. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. ‚ÄúNow they‚Äôre stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don‚Äôt have the capital to pay it.‚Äù Faced with such problems, some cryptocurrency traders have decided to avoid the issue entirely, by not declaring any cryptocurrency on their taxes and hoping for the best. According to Credit Karma, which provides tax-filing services, fewer than 100 of the 250,000 people who had used the company‚Äôs tax-filing software as of February reported cryptocurrency transactions, a rate below 0.04 percent. Even the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew weren‚Äôt planning to pay taxes on their crypto-gains. ‚ÄúThis is the smallest crypto event I‚Äôve been to,‚Äù said Mr. Schreibman, the I.T. consultant. ‚ÄúNo one believes they‚Äôll get in trouble.‚Äù All the traders at the event said they would do their best to pay their taxes in full. And they looked a little shellshocked, as if they had been rudely yanked out of a thrilling, consequence-free virtual world back into the real one. Peter Baniuszewicz, a cryptocurrency trader from Brooklyn, told me that this year‚Äôs tax season had come as a jolt of reality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Monopoly money anymore,‚Äù he said.

Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSAPRIL 30, 2018, 11:52 A.M. E.D.T.  NEW YORK ‚Äî  Andra Capital, a U.S. technology fund, has raised $500 million in funding for a new digital currency that investors can use to back a group of late-stage venture capital (VC) firms, the firm's managing partner Haydar Haba told Reuters. The new token is called Silicon Valley Coin (SVC), built on the Ethereum blockchain, representing investments in U.S. technology companies that are each worth at least $500 million. ""We're changing the dynamic in venture capital by providing more investors access to high-growth Silicon Valley assets,"" Haba said in an interview late last week. Haba declined to disclose the names of the investors. Andra will hold a public offering of the tokens in the summer. In the United States only accredited investors, or those with a net worth of $1 million, will be able to participate, Haba said. Non-U.S. individual investors can purchase the token depending on regulations in their countries. Advertisement Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Advertisement Andra's new coin is one of many ventures that have sought funding through public offerings: creating tokens on a blockchain and selling them to investors. About 80 percent of Andra's portfolio is in late-stage firms that have raised at least two rounds of funding from established venture capital companies, according to a company document that explains the offering. The remaining 20 percent will be in early-stage ventures.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Many late-stage private investments, which currently total about $500 billion, are limited to affluent limited partners and a few institutional investors, Haba said. Andra has created 1 billion coins, priced at $1 per token, to raise $1 billion overall, Haba said. Andra says it hopes investors can post significant capital appreciation over 30 to 60 months - the estimated investment time frame to maximize returns for late-stage companies. Most VCs have an average fund life of eight to 12 years. When a fund attracts investors, Andra said there is no system to determine the period in which the capital will be available. Andra's coin, on the other hand, can be immediately sold  following the initial issuance. Andra Capital said over a 10-year period, it is targeting an internal rate of return (IRR) of 30 percent. The top 5 percent of VCs have a 40 percent IRR over eight to 12 years, but they are very exclusive and limited to the well-connected and wealthy. Meanwhile, the average IRR for the median and top quartile VCs over the past ten years are 12 percent and 20 percent, respectively, according to the Andra document.

Sports,"Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAJUNE 8, 2017  CLEVELAND ‚Äî Draymond Green, human megaphone and starting forward for the Golden State Warriors, thought back on Thursday to an instance earlier this season when his teammate Kevin Durant expressed frustration with his own level of play. Durant was new to the Warriors, and perhaps he was pressing. Green, who has seen (and done) a bit of everything in his five seasons with the team, went over to offer some perspective. ‚ÄúHey, my friend,‚Äù Green recalled telling Durant. ‚ÄúTo be honest with you, we don‚Äôt really need you that much in the regular season. But you know, when those N.B.A. finals come around, we‚Äôre really going to need you to play big for us.‚Äù Durant, Green said, seemed reassured. And given Durant‚Äôs brilliant play so far in the finals, with the Warriors one victory from returning home to the Bay Area for another championship parade, that early-season conversation may have made a difference ‚Äî or at least it did, according to Green. Advertisement ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been playing big for us,‚Äù Green said of Durant, ‚Äúso I guess I‚Äôm a genius.‚Äù Green, in his own inimitable way, has left his imprint on the Warriors again this season. In the finals, with his rebounding, passing and defending, he has helped steer them to a 3-0 series lead against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Game 4 is scheduled for Friday night at Quicken Loans Arena. The Warriors are trying to become the first N.B.A. team to complete the playoffs with a 16-0 record. Advertisement ‚ÄúClose-out games are always the hardest,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to come out and fight. We know we have to try to pull a full 48 together if we want to close this thing out.‚Äù If Green‚Äôs numbers have been understated in the finals ‚Äî he is averaging 9.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5 assists while shooting just 34.5 percent from the field ‚Äî he is still having an outsize influence. In the postseason, Golden State has outscored its opponents by 227 points when Green has been on the court, giving him the second-best plus/minus on the team, behind Stephen Curry (plus 267). At the same time, Green has continued to relish his role as the team‚Äôs emotional center ‚Äî same as ever. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a natural leader, and he continues to refine the way he does it,‚Äù the assistant coach Ron Adams said.

A year ago, Green had an altogether different experience in the finals. Suspended for Game 5 against the Cavaliers after accumulating too many flagrant fouls over the course of the playoffs, Green was barred from even watching the game at Oracle Arena. He attended a baseball game instead. The Warriors lost without him ‚Äî a turning point in the series. The Cavaliers went on to win the title in seven games. It was an experience that stuck with Green, who has been adamant about never again putting himself in that type of situation. That does not mean he is playing without passion. On Wednesday, late in the first half of the Warriors‚Äô come-from-behind victory in Game 3, Green had a brief meltdown and was whistled for a technical foul. Durant had to pull him away from an official. ‚ÄúHe gathered himself, got it together, and we moved on,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt linger.‚Äù For the most part, though, Green has been noticeably less voluble in this series ‚Äî and somehow less visible, toiling in the shadows cast by teammates like Durant and Curry. But Green is still calculating and cunning. Consider his second-quarter theatrics in Game 3, when he got all over that official and then heard about it from the opposing crowd. Advertisement ‚ÄúI love that,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúThey are amazing. I appreciate those people out there.‚Äù While Green genuinely disagrees with many of the calls that go against him, many of his extracurriculars are scripted. He knows how to drive his teammates. ‚ÄúHe can get excited about this, that or the other thing,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúAnd sometimes, he‚Äôs trying to prove a point. Sometimes, he‚Äôs trying to rally his team when he does that. Sometimes, he‚Äôs trying to get himself going. But he usually has some method to his actions.‚Äù On Thursday, as Green spoke in muted tones about avoiding complacency and about focusing on the task at hand ‚Äî all very clich√©d for someone who typically has an endless stream of sharp opinions ‚Äî he identified a key to the Warriors‚Äô success this season. ‚ÄúUnselfishness,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúGuys aren‚Äôt worried about who‚Äôs taking the shots or who‚Äôs doing what at any given point. It‚Äôs about us putting ourselves in the best position that we can put ourselves in. I think we have a group of guys who enjoy playing together. We enjoy being around each other. We have fun. And then, also just having a bunch of guys who can make plays.‚Äù That was the big question when Durant joined the team last summer: Would these players be willing to make the necessary sacrifices? At the start of the season, Green and the rest of the team‚Äôs holdovers could sense Durant‚Äôs eagerness to fit in and contribute, which made an enormous difference to them. It was clear that everyone wanted this grand experiment to work. For Green, part of that has meant taking fewer shots and ceding some of the spotlight. But it has all been worth it. ‚ÄúEverybody,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis looking to make the play for the next guy.‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on June 9, 2017, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: This Year, Golden State‚Äôs Heart Has a Quieter Beat, but It‚Äôs Still Strong.

Technology,"Advertisement By NELLIE BOWLESFEB. 25, 2018  PALO ALTO, Calif. ‚Äî When a cryptocurrency start-up that promised to revolutionize the fruit and vegetable industry shut down last month, it left behind one word on its website: penis. When a virtual currency company called DateCoin recently tried to entice investors for its initial coin offering, it posted a Facebook ad that featured a reclining woman in a swimsuit with text over her body that read, ‚ÄúTouch my I.C.O.‚Äù And after the North American Bitcoin Conference in January, which highlighted 84 male speakers and three women, the official conference party was held at a Miami strip club. Virtual currencies and blockchain, the digital ledger that forms the basis of the cryptocurrencies, were intended to be democratizing and equalizing forces, buoyed by a utopian exuberance. But women who have been trying to participate in the gold rush are finding a lopsided gender divide. And some say the culture is getting worse, with the male-dominated culture buoyed by a new fleet of wealthy crypto speculators known as ‚Äúblockchain bros.‚Äù Advertisement That means the budding world is already in danger of looking like the rest of the technology industry, where women are decidedly a minority. Some studies estimate that women account for only 4 percent to 6 percent of blockchain investors. That imbalance matters because the early days of an industry are often when the fortunes are made ‚Äî and those big winners then choose whom to invest in and what to build next, launching a cascade of consequences. Now, some early female investors and entrepreneurs are beginning to sound the alarm and push back. ‚ÄúWomen, consider crypto,‚Äù Alexia Bonatsos, a venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúOtherwise the men are going to get all the wealth, again.‚Äù Some crypto leaders are now organizing events, clubs and conferences to attract women to the industry. Ms. Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco. And Jalak Jobanputra, founder of the start-up investment firm Future Perfect Ventures, and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue. They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitment. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions,‚Äù Ms. Jobanputra said. She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded next. Arianna Simpson, an early cryptocurrency investor, said the surge of interest in virtual currencies from male novices should remind women that it did not take expertise or a Ph.D. to thrive in the ecosystem. ‚ÄúWomen always question if they‚Äôre qualified,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut look at these clowns around us.‚Äù The response to some of the events has been encouraging, some of the women said. Brit Morin, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour. She moved the meeting to a bigger venue, where all 500 seats sold out again. So she set up a livestream for the event; that evening, 16,000 viewers joined to watch. ‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems,‚Äù Ms. Morin said. ‚ÄúWomen want to be part of that.‚Äù The resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies, punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoin‚Äôs Facebook ad and Prodeum, the blockchain-for-fruit start-up. Neither company returned requests for comment. The gender imbalance was also on display at last month‚Äôs North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, which was organized by a prominent investor, Moe Levin. Mr. Levin originally slated 86 men and one woman as speakers. After complaints, he replaced two of the men with women to achieve what he thought should be enough: 84 men onstage and three women. ‚ÄúIt just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers,‚Äù Mr. Levin said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not intentional not to include them. It‚Äôs just we don‚Äôt have time to include them.‚Äù Advertisement When others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conference‚Äôs after-party would be held at a strip club, they encouraged Mr. Levin to change locations. He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could find. ‚ÄúDowntown Miami doesn‚Äôt have a whole lot of event spaces,‚Äù Mr. Levin said. ‚ÄúAnd we needed a lot of security.‚Äù The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.

The year before, the conference‚Äôs kickoff party featured underwear-clad models ‚Äî painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logos. ‚ÄúMoe does something just as sexist every year,‚Äù said Rose Chan, who founded the World Bank‚Äôs blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project. ‚ÄúHe switches it up, which actually means that he thinks about it.‚Äù One group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the future. Mr. Levin said this reaction surprised him. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many people who had a great time,‚Äù he said. At some women-in-crypto events, frustration is giving way to anger and sadness. On a recent night, about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Woman‚Äôs Club of Palo Alto. Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford University. Over wine, they shared their stories ‚Äî some had been mistaken for hired models, others propositioned during job interviews, and many men had not believed they were engineers at all. Catheryne Nicholson, the chief executive of BlockCypher, which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications, explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deteriorated. Advertisement ‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs a lot of money, and the men think, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm a whale now,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a little more full of themselves.‚Äù Karen Hsu, BlockCypher‚Äôs head of growth, said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated. She said that at a recent conference, she had been asked if she was a speaker, which was validating. ‚ÄúIt was nice because he didn‚Äôt think I was a booth babe,‚Äù Ms. Hsu said, referring to hired models who stand near the booths of start-ups to draw the attention of conference attendees. Other women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down. Jay Graber, a developer at Zcash, a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy, was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear. She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks. Now she‚Äôs not so sure. ‚ÄúI never felt insecure before I got into this space,‚Äù Ms. Graber said. ‚ÄúBut I just realized there is no one else like me.

Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSMAY 3, 2018, 4:07 A.M. E.D.T.  BERLIN ‚Äî  Aerospace suppliers are starting to explore blockchain technology to keep tabs on their supply chain, potentially tracking parts such as that at the center of a Southwest Airlines accident last month. While blockchain is best known as the digital transactions technology that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin, it can also be harnessed to track, record and transfer assets across all manner of industries, potentially smoothing operations, cutting costs and improving cash management. The challenge faced by the aerospace industry in keeping track of tens of thousands of different parts came to light when it emerged after last month's fatal explosion that some airlines do not keep track of the history of each individual fan blade within an engine. In addition to the operational and cost benefits, improved parts management could speed up safety checks after an accident, industry experts said, and an increasing number of aerospace suppliers are looking at blockchain as a potential solution. Advertisement Blockchain offers a secure encrypted audit trail because there is only one version of the data, meaning it can be used to ensure traceability without reams of paperwork. It is already being used to track cobalt on its journey from Congo mines to smartphones, for example. Advertisement Moog, a U.S. manufacturer of flight control systems, is working with partners to create a blockchain-based solution called VeriPart, which will initially be used to track 3D printed components. Moog's technology chief George Small said the aerospace industry, like other highly regulated sectors such as the medical and nuclear power industries, was expending considerable effort on tracking parts across the supply chain to keep up with quality and regulatory demands. TRANSPARENCY Small said the use of blockchain could increase efficiency and transparency in the sharing of data and that customer feedback has been positive so far. Though VeriPart is still in development, Moog has already had talks with customers on other potential uses for the technology. ""The solution is broadly applicable to manufactured goods and associated data that need to be tracked across supply chains from origin to delivery and on into service,"" Small said in an emailed response to questions. Advocates for the technology say transparency is ensured by the encrypted audit trail and because blockchains are open and decentralized, allowing different parties to share information. Engine maker Rolls-Royce is among those working with blockchain developers to establish how it could be used in the supply chain and says it is rapidly developing solutions. ""The company sees opportunities to automate records for complex products that currently require significant manual effort to ensure they are well managed,"" a Rolls-Royce spokesman said. Advertisement Technology company Sabre, which has been looking at various uses for blockchain in the travel and aviation industries, said it could see the case for using it as a system to track components. ""It's a situation where you don't need ultra fast technology, but you need to be able to trust what's in the blockchain record,"" said Philip Likens, director of Sabre Labs. Likens said the technology could be used to show who created what part on what date, when it was put on a plane and then how many hours the plane was in operation.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. ""You want to know that all those things are right and correct, that's the immutability part,"" he said, referring to how blockchain entries cannot be changed. Planemaker Airbus, meanwhile, is looking for a blockchain solution architect to be based at one of its sites in either Toulouse, Filton, Broughton or Hamburg, according to an online job posting. It has formed a working group within the company to identify business challenges worth addressing with blockchain and a spokeswoman said the supply chain seems a natural fit. ""Blockchain could improve the tracking of goods and become a complement to, not a wholesale replacement of, suppliers' procurement software,"" she said EXAGGERATED CAPABILITIES? But blockchain isn't the only technology that can be used to keep a closer eye on parts in the supply chain. Enders Analysis, in a wide-ranging note on blockchain and its use across various industries, says that a lot of the capabilities of blockchain are exaggerated or misunderstood and that existing technology can often perform the same roles. Advertisement It says that while blockchain-inspired technology could be used to bring transparency to supply chain management, it could be hard to guarantee that goods really were delivered as specified on the blockchain. ""Upgrading systems to take advantage of technological progress is important and can increase efficiency,"" the analysts wrote in general advice to any company looking at blockchain. ""But those ends are much more important than the means: there is no point deploying blockchain ‚Äì or a product marketed as blockchain ‚Äì just for the sake of it."" In an example of other technology that can be used to improve supply chain efficiency, Airbus last week signed up aircraft structures maker Premium Aerotec to its cloud-based aviation data platform, Skywise. The platform will take order, production and quality data from Airbus and Premium Aerotec and analyze the data with a view to keeping the manufacturing process stable and providing transparency in the supply chain. ""To build the aircraft, Airbus needs to know where the parts are and when they are coming,"" Premium Aerotec CEO Thomas Ehm told Reuters, adding that the Skywise platform aims to provide much better visibility of the manufacturing process.

The most important of these zombies is the ‚Äúsupply side‚Äù insistence that cutting taxes on the rich reliably produces economic miracles, and conversely that raising taxes on the rich is a recipe for disaster. Faith in this doctrine survived the boom that followed Bill Clinton‚Äôs tax hikes, the lackluster recovery and eventual catastrophe that followed George W. Bush‚Äôs tax cuts, the debacle in Kansas, and more. And Donald Trump‚Äôs selection of Larry Kudlow to head the National Economic Council confirms that the tax-cut zombie is undead and well. For Kudlow is a fervent believer in the infinite virtues of tax cuts, despite a track record of predictions based on that belief that, as New York magazine‚Äôs Jonathan Chait once wrote, ‚Äúhas elevated flamboyant wrongness to a form of performance art.‚Äù Yet there is more to economic policy than taxes; Trump himself, while willing to sign whatever tax cuts Congress sends him, seems far more interested in international policy, in particular the supposed evils of trade deficits. And that‚Äôs where things get interesting. You see, now that ‚Äúglobalists‚Äù like Gary Cohn have left, all the people advising Trump on international economics are, like those advising him on everything else, in thrall to zombie ideas. But there‚Äôs more than one kind of zombie. In fact, there are in effect two factions ‚Äî equally wrong, but wrong in different, almost opposite ways. You might say that when it comes to international trade, Trumpworld is heading for a kind of zombie civil war. On one side, we have the neo-mercantilists ‚Äî people like Peter Navarro, Trump‚Äôs trade czar ‚Äî who see world trade as a tale of winners and losers: Countries with trade surpluses win; those with trade deficits lose. Both logic and history say that this view is nonsense: Trade surpluses are often a sign of weakness, trade deficits sometimes a sign of strength (as a matter of arithmetic, a country that attracts more inward investment from foreigners than it invests abroad must run a trade deficit). And the neo-mercantilists have a habit of making crude errors, like misunderstanding how value-added taxes work. Still, they have Trump‚Äôs ear, because the rocks in their heads fit the holes in his: They‚Äôre telling him what he wants to hear, because their errors play to his gut instincts, and when it comes to policy, he don‚Äôt need no education. Yet they‚Äôre not the only faction talking dangerous nonsense on international economics. The Trump administration has also become home to what we might call neo-goldbugs: people who think that a nation‚Äôs strength can be measured by the strength of its currency, and refuse to see any downside in a strong dollar, never see any reason a weaker dollar might be needed. Like neo-mercantilism, or for that matter supply-side economics, this view has been debunked many times ‚Äî I wrote about it in 1987! ‚Äî yet keeps shambling along, because it appeals to the prejudices of wealthy and powerful people. Until now, the most visible neo-goldbug in the administration has been David Malpass, the under secretary of Treasury for international affairs ‚Äî normally a position of great policy influence, although under Trump, who knows? Malpass is the former chief economist of Bear Stearns, and a man with a Kudlow-like record of being wrong about everything. In particular, however, back in 2011 Malpass published an op-ed article declaring that what America needed to fix its economic ills was a stronger dollar (and higher interest rates). It was a bizarre claim. After all, at the time the unemployment rate was still 9 percent ‚Äî and a stronger dollar would have made things even worse. Why? Because it would have made U.S. products less competitive, increasing the trade deficit ‚Äî and a situation of persistently high unemployment is the one situation in which trade deficits really are an unambiguously bad thing, reducing the demand for domestic goods and services. But here‚Äôs the thing: Kudlow appears to share Malpass‚Äôs worldview. In fact, his first newsworthy statement after Trump announced his selection was a call for a higher dollar ‚Äî something that would worsen the very trade deficit Trump sees as a sign of American weakness. Why has Trump hired people with such conflicting notions about international economic policy? The answer, presumably, is that he doesn‚Äôt understand the issues well enough to realize that the conflict exists. And what both sides in this dispute share is a general propensity for invincible ignorance, which makes them Trump‚Äôs kind of people. Anyway, on international economics the Trump administration is now on track for a battle of the zombies ‚Äî a fight between two sets of bad ideas that refuse to die. Pass the popcorn.

Business,"Advertisement By KEITH BRADSHERMAY 4, 2018  BEIJING ‚Äî Senior Chinese and American officials concluded two days of negotiations on Friday with no deal and no date set for further talks, as the United States stepped up its demands for Chinese concessions to avert a potential trade war. The American negotiating team, which included Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer, headed for the airport after the talks and did not release a statement. But a list of demands that the group took into the meeting called for reducing the United States‚Äô trade gap with China by $200 billion over the next two years and a halt on Chinese subsidies for advanced manufacturing sectors. The demands, which spread on Chinese social media and were confirmed by a person close to the negotiations, suggested that both sides hardened their positions this week despite the two days of talks. Senior Chinese officials and their advisers were also sending a deliberate message to the West that the days of Beijing being conciliatory were over, and that China was staking out its own position in the negotiations. The person close to the negotiations insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. The extensive list of United States trade demands was unexpectedly sweeping, and showed that the Trump administration has no intention of backing down despite Beijing‚Äôs assertive stance in the last few days. ‚ÄúThe list reads like the terms for a surrender rather than a basis for negotiation,‚Äù said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. Advertisement Here are the highlights of the demands: China must ‚Ä¶ ‚ñ† Cut its trade surplus by $100 billion in the 12 months starting in June, and by another $100 billion in the following 12 months. ‚ñ† Halt all subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries in its so-called Made In China 2025 program. The program covers 10 sectors, including aircraft manufacturing, electric cars, robotics, computer microchips and artificial intelligence. ‚ñ† Accept that the United States may restrict imports from the industries under Made in China 2025. ‚ñ† Take ‚Äúimmediate, verifiable steps‚Äù to halt cyberespionage into commercial networks in the United States. ‚ñ† Strengthen intellectual property protections. ‚ñ† Accept United States restrictions on Chinese investments in sensitive technologies without retaliating. ‚ñ† Cut its tariffs, which currently average 10 percent, to the same level as in the United States, where they average 3.5 percent for all ‚Äúnoncritical sectors.‚Äù ‚ñ† Open up its services and agricultural sectors to full American competition. The United States also stipulated that the two sides should meet every quarter to review progress. Chinese officials put the talks in a positive light. ‚ÄúThe two sides agreed that a sound and stable China-U.S. trade relationship is crucial for both, and they are committed to resolving relevant economic and trade issues through dialogue and consultation,‚Äù Xinhua, the official news agency, said soon after the talks ended. Advertisement But the negotiations also highlighted key differences ‚Äî and the American delegation‚Äôs tight-lipped departure from Diaoyutai, the parklike enclosure of guesthouses where the talks were held, suggested that the two sides had made little headway in solving them. Before the trade talks began, people involved in China‚Äôs policymaking said, Beijing was willing to act on some concessions previously laid out by President Xi Jinping. Among the most notable was a willingness to make it slightly easier for foreign automakers and financial services companies to compete in China. But China has its own demands. Beijing wants the United States to relax restrictions on exports of high-tech commercial products that may have military applications. During the trade talks here this week, Chinese officials also took issue with the penalties that American officials imposed last month on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, for repeatedly violating United States sanctions on Iran. The Commerce Department banned all shipments of American wares to ZTE, including chips and other equipment that are essential to many of the company‚Äôs products. The move appears to have strengthened China‚Äôs resolve to continue its drive for self-sufficiency and to curb imports in various high-tech fields. China‚Äôs push to upgrade its technology accounts for many of its disagreements with the United States. The American document reiterated Trump administration calls for a broad halt of Chinese subsidies to manufacturers in advanced technology industries. And Chinese officials have defended the Made in 2025 program as essential to upgrading the economy and have said they would not agree to any limits on the Made in China program. Beijing has said it would be willing to reduce some trade barriers, but only if the United States also lowered trade barriers. Chinese officials particularly object to American limits on the export of high-tech goods that have both civilian and military applications, contending that these restrictions prevent sizable potential exports.

They also objected to United States demands for a specific cut in the bilateral surplus. Li Gang, the vice president of the Commerce Ministry‚Äôs research and training institute, said in a separate interview last month that a $100 billion cut in the surplus was ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù China‚Äôs surplus has been widening lately as the United States economy grows fairly strongly and takes in more imports. The Commerce Department announced on Thursday in Washington that the trade imbalance with China had widened slightly in March compared with the same month a year ago, although it narrowed slightly compared with February, possibly for seasonal reasons. Advertisement The lack of a deal this week, as well as the failure to schedule further talks right away, does not rule out the possibility that Chinese negotiators will visit the United States next month for further talks. One possibility that American officials have considered is whether China might send Vice President Wang Qishan, who is close to Mr. Xi, on a follow-up trip. So far, the Chinese side has been led by Liu He, a Politburo member who is also the vice premier for finance, trade and technology. Trade experts have been saying for weeks that Chinese officials would like to resolve the dispute with the United States so that they can go back to focusing on issues closer to home. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the immediate problem, because it‚Äôs a headache for them that‚Äôs distracting from a very pressing domestic agenda,‚Äù said Christopher K. Johnson, a former C.I.A. officer who analyzed China and now holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Beijing talks were unlikely to result in a comprehensive deal, but experts said they could still be a first step toward reaching some sort of accord. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way our team is going to risk signing up to something without getting back here and making sure that Trump is happy with it first,‚Äù Mr. Johnson said. ‚ÄúMaybe there‚Äôs also some optics where Trump wants to be seen standing with Wang Qishan and striking the deal.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre still several jumps down the track from that.‚Äù Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.

Politics,"Advertisement By JOHN WILLIAMSSEPT. 12, 2017  Conspiracies surrounding Russian meddling in American politics used to be the terrain of novelists. Now nonfiction writers get to dig in. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat Happened,‚Äù her account of the 2016 presidential election, went on sale Tuesday, and another book about the election, an investigative look by two journalists into the controversies surrounding Donald J.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. President Trump‚Äôs recent threat to escalate his trade skirmish with China into a full-scale trade war is a foolish gambit with little historical precedent. It is also hard to take seriously, given how quickly Mr. Trump changes his mind and how rarely and clumsily he tends to follow through on tough talk. Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he wants to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports in response to Beijing‚Äôs plan to retaliate against an earlier American proposal that was aimed at $50 billion in Chinese goods. The president also said he was seeking ways to protect American farmers hurt by Chinese retaliation ‚Äî a move that could result in fresh trade fights with other countries as they seek to defend their farmers from subsidized American grain. If you‚Äôre confused or shocked by these announcements, you are not alone. Most experts say that a trade war between the world‚Äôs two largest economies would hurt American businesses, farmers and workers whose profits and livelihoods depend in part on commerce with China. That‚Äôs probably why the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500-stock index fell more than 2 percent on Friday. Historians say there is little precedent for Mr. Trump‚Äôs direct and forceful targeting of China. The last time a president used trade policy to hurt specific nations was when Thomas Jefferson and Congress restricted trade with Britain and France in the early 1800s, said Douglas Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College who recently published a history of American trade policy. Those trade battles ended up leading to the War of 1812. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen anything like this in centuries,‚Äù he said. Even the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs that Congress enacted in 1930 were put in place to protect struggling domestic industries and farmers, not to penalize specific countries. Of course, those tariffs did not quite work as intended, because other countries moved to shield their own economies by raising tariffs, too. Experts now believe those trade policies probably exacerbated the Great Depression. Mr. Trump‚Äôs bombast is so odd that it has scrambled the usual politics of trade. Many Republican lawmakers, including those who support him on most issues, have come out strongly against him on trade. For example, Pat Roberts, a senator from Kansas, said the impact of the president‚Äôs threats against China was ‚Äúdisconcerting,‚Äù and Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa said American farmers and ranchers ‚Äúwould bear the brunt of retaliation‚Äù by China. At the same time, Mr. Trump has won praise from some Democrats, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who are opposed to many other Trump policies. The big question now is what Mr. Trump will actually do. Some officials ‚Äî like Larry Kudlow, the former cable-TV pundit who recently became the top economic adviser in the White House ‚Äî are trying to tamp down talk of a trade war, and say the administration is using the threat of tariffs to get China to the negotiating table. To Mr. Kudlow‚Äôs way of thinking, the Trump strategy is similar to how President Ronald Reagan got Japan to voluntarily limit exports to the United States in the 1980s by threatening to impose steep tariffs. There is a strong case to be made that the United States needs to do all it can to get Chinese officials to change economic policies that have hurt American businesses and workers. For example, officials in Beijing have forced foreign businesses to transfer technology to local joint-venture partners as a condition of doing business in China. China for many years also artificially depressed the value of its currency, the renminbi, against the dollar to make its clothes, electronics and other products more affordable to American consumers. But it is hard to see this administration striking an effective and comprehensive deal with China. That‚Äôs because Mr. Trump and his officials seem incapable of putting in the time and hard work required to hammer out such agreements with other countries or political adversaries. They have also displayed little of the finesse and diplomacy needed to strike international deals. Consider, for example, the trade deal the administration struck with South Korea last month. Experts say that it will do little to increase American exports to that country and will only modestly reduce imports to the United States. A day after formally announcing that agreement, Mr. Trump said he might delay it in an effort to pressure North Korea to reach a deal on its nuclear weapons. That about-face would no doubt make other countries reluctant to reach an agreement with this president ‚Äî they could never be sure if a deal was a deal. Or take the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration has been renegotiating for months. American officials have apparently walked back from some of their most aggressive demands in recent talks, The Times recently reported. Those changes might make it easier to get agreements with Canada and Mexico. But they could leave many domestic groups disappointed with Mr. Trump ‚Äî as were many of the workers at Carrier whose jobs he claims to have saved early in his presidency but who were eventually laid off anyway. Some Democratic lawmakers, American labor unions and other groups that theoretically support Mr. Trump‚Äôs tougher trade policies are worried that their priorities, like a provision requiring Mexico to improve labor rights for factory workers, will not be included in a new trade agreement. Mr. Trump has dramatically raised the stakes on trade with his brash pronouncements about tariffs. But there‚Äôs little cause to hope he and his team can deliver the big economic gains that they argue can come only from such a combative approach.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michelle Goldberg Three months ago, The Washington Post reported that even as Donald Trump ran for president, he pursued plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The next day, The New York Times published excerpts from emails between Felix Sater, a felon with ties to Russian organized crime, and Michael Cohen, one of Donald Trump‚Äôs lawyers and Sater‚Äôs childhood friend, about the project. Sater was apparently an intermediary between Trump and Russia, and in a Nov. 3, 2015, email to Cohen, he made the strange argument that a successful deal would lead to Trump‚Äôs becoming president. Boasting that he was close enough to Vladimir Putin to let Ivanka Trump sit in the Russian president‚Äôs desk chair, Sater wrote, ‚ÄúI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected.‚Äù These stories were, at the time, bombshells. At a minimum, they showed that Trump was lying when he said, repeatedly, that he had ‚Äúnothing to do with Russia.‚Äù Further, Sater‚Äôs logic ‚Äî that Putin‚Äôs buy-in on a real estate deal would result in Trump‚Äôs election ‚Äî was bizarre, suggesting that some part of the proposed collaboration was left unsaid. But three months feels like three decades in Trump years, and I mostly forgot about these reports until I read Luke Harding‚Äôs new book, ‚ÄúCollusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.‚Äù One uncanny aspect of the investigations into Trump‚Äôs Russia connections is that instead of too little evidence there‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs impossible to keep it straight without the kind of chaotic wall charts that Carrie Mathison of ‚ÄúHomeland‚Äù assembled during her manic episodes. Incidents that would be major scandals in a normal administration ‚Äî like the mere fact of Trump‚Äôs connection to Sater ‚Äî become minor subplots in this one. That‚Äôs why ‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù is so essential, and why I wish everyone who is skeptical that Russia has leverage over Trump would read it. This country ‚Äî at least the parts not wholly under the sway of right-wing propaganda ‚Äî needs to come to terms with substantial evidence that the president is in thrall to a foreign power. Harding, the former Moscow bureau chief of The Guardian, has been reporting on shady characters like Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was indicted last month, long before Trump announced his candidacy. He was able to interview Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier attempting to detail Trump‚Äôs relationship with the Kremlin, and who describes the conspiracy between the American president and the Russians as ‚Äúmassive ‚Äî absolutely massive.‚Äù ‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù doesn‚Äôt purport to solve all the mysteries of this alleged conspiracy. There‚Äôs no longer any serious question that there was cooperation between Trump‚Äôs campaign and Russia, but the extent of the cooperation, and the precise nature of it, remains opaque. Harding makes a strong case for Steele‚Äôs credibility, but Steele reportedly said that the raw intelligence in his dossier is only 70 percent to 90 percent accurate, so it‚Äôs hard to know which parts of it to believe. But Harding‚Äôs book is invaluable in collating the overwhelming evidence of a web of relationships between the Kremlin, Trump and members of Trump‚Äôs circle. He suggests, convincingly, that Russia may have been cultivating Trump since the 1980s. At that time, Harding writes, the K.G.B. was working to draw ‚Äúprominent figures in the West‚Äù ‚Äî as the K.G.B. described them ‚Äî into collaboration. According to Harding, a form for evaluating targets asked, ‚ÄúAre pride, arrogance, egoism, ambition or vanity among subject‚Äôs natural characteristics?‚Äù Last week, The Times reported that many Russian critics of Putin deplore America‚Äôs fixation on Moscow‚Äôs role in the election, since it reinforces Putin‚Äôs image of himself as an ‚Äúever-victorious master strategist‚Äù controlling world affairs. The article quoted Ivan Kurilla, a Russian historian and America expert: ‚ÄúAmerican liberals are so upset about Trump that they cannot believe he is a real product of American life. They try to portray him as something created by Russia.‚Äù As one of those American liberals, I don‚Äôt think this is quite right. Trump, the gaudy huckster who treats closing a sale as the height of human endeavor, is a quintessentially American figure. His campaign of racial and religious grievance drew on the darkest currents of American history. At most, Putin appears to have recognized an opportunity that American political dysfunction created. It‚Äôs a sign of how deep that dysfunction goes that the substantial evidence that the president is not a patriot hasn‚Äôt caused more of a political earthquake. America, stunned and divided, appears incapable of metabolizing all we‚Äôre learning about the man in the White House. Yes, we have investigations, but the business of government plods on; right now the Senate is working on the Roy Moore of tax bills, a piece of legislation that magnifies right-wing pathologies into a cartoonish grotesque. It wasn‚Äôt Putin who fashioned a Republican Party willing to tolerate something close to treason if it‚Äôs the price of corporate tax cuts. Even if all the Republicans in Congress read Harding‚Äôs book, they probably wouldn‚Äôt act. But at least they‚Äôd know what they‚Äôre abetting.

Business,"Advertisement By ANA SWANSONFEB. 9, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Tariffs imposed by the United States late last month are prompting a wave of litigation from other nations, including Canada and China, escalating concerns that the Trump administration‚Äôs more aggressive trade stance could worsen international relations and spur retaliatory actions on American goods sent abroad. On Wednesday, three Canadian solar companies filed a lawsuit in a New York court over tariffs on solar cells and panels that the United States imposed in late January, claiming these penalties violate American law and the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. That same day, the European Union became the fourth member of the World Trade Organization to request discussions with the United States for compensation for the solar tariffs, following similar requests by China, Taiwan and South Korea. Chinese officials also confirmed last weekend that they had launched a separate investigation into whether American exports of sorghum were receiving government subsidies or being sold at unfairly low prices abroad ‚Äî a measure widely interpreted as a response to the Trump administration‚Äôs ratcheting up of trade barriers. With the Trump administration considering further trade actions on Chinese products and foreign metals this year, some trade analysts are concerned that other American products, from soybeans to Kentucky bourbon, could become a target for retaliation. Advertisement Darci Vetter, a former chief agricultural negotiator for the United States trade representative, called China‚Äôs sorghum case just the latest example of American agriculture landing in the cross hairs as trade tensions rise. Advertisement ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the agriculture sector knows from experience that when tit-for-tat trade actions begin, agricultural products are the first to be hit,‚Äù Ms. Vetter said. ‚ÄúGiven the size and importance of China‚Äôs market for a variety of U.S. ag products, we are concerned it won‚Äôt be the last.‚Äù The Trump administration announced Jan. 22 that it would impose tariffs of up to 50 percent on imported washing machines and 30 percent on imported solar cells and modules, responding to a pair of trade cases alleging that cheap foreign products were degrading American manufacturing capacity.

Those tariffs were not as high as what the companies bringing the complaints had requested, or some of the recommendations made by the officials of the United States International Trade Commission. Still, many economists, consumer groups and businesses warned that the tariffs would lead to higher prices and could even end up costing more jobs than they would save. These groups are still waiting to see whether the Trump administration fulfills its most ambitious plans for remaking trade policy. In the coming months, the administration is expected to introduce a hefty penalty on China for encroaching on American intellectual property, which could include tariffs on consumer electronics or restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States. The fate of two separate trade actions, on imports of steel and aluminum, appears less certain. Last June, President Trump said that the steel industry would be seeing action ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù But the idea of these tariffs was met with a swift backlash from industries that use the metals to produce other goods, like carmakers, as well as some Defense Department officials. Since the Commerce Department submitted its reports on the investigations to the president last month, the cases have not been mentioned in official statements, including the White House‚Äôs summary of its current trade actions released after the president‚Äôs State of the Union address. The resignation this week of Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, who was responsible for organizing weekly meetings of White House trade advisers and bridging deep divides in views on trade among the staff, throws the fate of these measures into further question. Advertisement Depending on what happens at the World Trade Organization, the United States could see further retaliation against the solar tariff, said Allan T. Marks, a lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy. The World Trade Organization will now consider whether countries like China had sufficient opportunity to consult with the United States before the tariffs were imposed, and if the United States followed its rules for creating such temporary safeguards for its industries. Mr. Marks declined to speculate on the potential results, but said that the most recent precedent could be troubling for the United States. The last time that the United States imposed these kinds of tariffs, on steel imports under President George W. Bush in 2002, the World Trade Organization ruled that they were illegal, clearing the way for countries to lawfully retaliate against the United States. Under the threat of retaliation, the Bush administration withdrew the steel tariffs in 2003. ‚ÄúYou could see retaliation from exporting countries like China that are hurt by the safeguard action,‚Äù Mr. Marks said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll probably get there. That‚Äôs what happened for steel.‚Äù Follow Ana Swanson on Twitter: @AnaSwanson. Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSMAY 2, 2018, 12:16 P.M. E.D.T.  BERLIN ‚Äî  Aerospace suppliers are starting to explore blockchain technology to keep tabs on their supply chain, potentially tracking parts such as those identified as the cause of a Southwest Airlines accident last month. While blockchain is best known as the digital transactions technology that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin, it can also be harnessed to track, record and transfer assets across all manner of industries, potentially smoothing operations, cutting costs and improving cash management. The challenge faced by the aerospace industry in keeping track of tens of thousands of different parts came to light when it emerged after last month's fatal explosion that some airlines do not keep track of the history of each individual fan blade within an engine. In addition to the operational and cost benefits, improved parts management could speed up safety checks after an accident, industry experts said, and an increasing number of aerospace suppliers are looking at blockchain as a potential solution. Advertisement Blockchain offers a secure encrypted audit trail because there is only one version of the data, meaning it can be used to ensure traceability without reams of paperwork. It is already being used to track cobalt on its journey from Congo mines to smartphones, for example. Advertisement Moog, a U.S. manufacturer of flight control systems, is working with partners to create a blockchain-based solution called VeriPart, which will initially be used to track 3D printed components. Moog's technology chief George Small said the aerospace industry, like other highly regulated sectors such as the medical and nuclear power industries, was expending considerable effort on tracking parts across the supply chain to keep up with quality and regulatory demands. TRANSPARENCY Small said the use of blockchain could increase efficiency and transparency in the sharing of data and that customer feedback has been positive so far. Though VeriPart is still in development, Moog has already had talks with customers on other potential uses for the technology. ""The solution is broadly applicable to manufactured goods and associated data that need to be tracked across supply chains from origin to delivery and on into service,"" Small said in an emailed response to questions. Advocates for the technology say transparency is ensured by the encrypted audit trail and because blockchains are open and decentralized, allowing different parties to share information. Engine maker Rolls-Royce is among those working with blockchain developers to establish how it could be used in the supply chain and says it is rapidly developing solutions. ""The company sees opportunities to automate records for complex products that currently require significant manual effort to ensure they are well managed,"" a Rolls-Royce spokesman said. Advertisement Technology company Sabre, which has been looking at various uses for blockchain in the travel and aviation industries, said it could see the case for using it as a system to track components. ""It's a situation where you don't need ultra fast technology, but you need to be able to trust what's in the blockchain record,"" said Philip Likens, director of Sabre Labs. Likens said the technology could be used to show who created what part on what date, when it was put on a plane and then how many hours the plane was in operation.

""You want to know that all those things are right and correct, that's the immutability part,"" he said, referring to how blockchain entries cannot be changed. Planemaker Airbus, meanwhile, is looking for a blockchain solution architect to be based at one of its sites in either Toulouse, Filton, Broughton or Hamburg, according to an online job posting. It has formed a working group within the company to identify business challenges worth addressing with blockchain and a spokeswoman said the supply chain seems a natural fit. ""Blockchain could improve the tracking of goods and become a complement to, not a wholesale replacement of, suppliers' procurement software,"" she said EXAGGERATED CAPABILITIES? But blockchain isn't the only technology that can be used to keep a closer eye on parts in the supply chain. Enders Analysis, in a wide-ranging note on blockchain and its use across various industries, says that a lot of the capabilities of blockchain are exaggerated or misunderstood and that existing technology can often perform the same roles.

""Upgrading systems to take advantage of technological progress is important and can increase efficiency,"" the analysts wrote in general advice to any company looking at blockchain. ""But those ends are much more important than the means: there is no point deploying blockchain ‚Äì or a product marketed as blockchain ‚Äì just for the sake of it."" In an example of other technology that can be used to improve supply chain efficiency, Airbus last week signed up aircraft structures maker Premium Aerotec to its cloud-based aviation data platform, Skywise. The platform will take order, production and quality data from Airbus and Premium Aerotec and analyze the data with a view to keeping the manufacturing process stable and providing transparency in the supply chain. ""To build the aircraft, Airbus needs to know where the parts are and when they are coming,"" Premium Aerotec CEO Thomas Ehm told Reuters, adding that the Skywise platform aims to provide much better visibility of the manufacturing process.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Essay By John Schwartz Sometimes life shows you what absurd really is. This is one of those times. I‚Äôm talking about the phenomenon known as Bitcoin, a monetary system based on computation, complex algorithms and ‚Äî let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî communal delusion. You‚Äôve probably heard about this funny money, digital tokens that can be sent securely from computer to computer, with records kept through an online accounting system known as blockchain. (My colleague Nathaniel Popper has been writing great stuff about it.) Millions of people now have accounts with Coinbase, the leading marketplace for digital currencies. And the rush into the market has helped push prices up. At the beginning of last year, you could pick up a Bitcoin (not literally, because they‚Äôre virtual, DUH) for about a thousand bucks. Its gyrations briefly brought its price near $20,000, according to Blockchain.info, which tracks such things. So what‚Äôs the problem? Let me answer that question with a question: What do you know about tulips? Yes, I am referring to the Dutch tulip craze back in the 17th century, and the speculative bubble that preceded the stock market crash of 1929, and the dot-com boom and crash that started in the late 1990s. Remember that last one, when learned analysts told us that advancing technology had eliminated the business cycle? Good times. No bubble is too big to burst. But hey, no regrets! Carpe Bitcoin! (But not literally.) Signs of a bubble seem to be everywhere in the Bitcoin world today. Companies are trying to cash in by sprinkling themselves with a little Bitcoin fairy dust. Take the company called Long Island Iced Tea, which makes, you know, tea. The price of its shares nearly doubled one day last month after it announced that it would change its name to ‚ÄúLong Blockchain Corp.‚Äù The company‚Äôs announcement claimed it would ‚Äúpursue opportunities‚Äù in blockchain technology. Which makes it sound as if some of those teas they brew are highly caffeinated. Or that people are indulging in that other kind of Long Island Iced Tea. I called Christian Day, a professor at Syracuse University law school who has written about bubbles and panics. He said that comparing Bitcoin to the tulip craze was unfair to tulips: ‚ÄúThe Dutch were not as crazy as they‚Äôve been portrayed.‚Äù For one thing, the tulip bulbs were real, he said, and the hybrids that were the subject of speculation could be extremely valuable. What‚Äôs more, much of the trading was done by people who knew their horticulture. With the modern techno-tulips, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything there.‚Äù Some of the most skeptical folks are experts in cryptography and computer security. Steven Bellovin, an adept in computer security and a professor at Columbia University, told me that the technology is still too buggy, ‚Äúa lab experiment that escaped into the wild.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to trust a currency, he said, that‚Äôs ‚Äúbacked by the full faith and credit of software that has to be updated monthly.‚Äù Another security expert, Matt Blaze, recently tweeted, ‚ÄúCryptocurrency somehow combines everything we love about religious fanatics with everything we love about Ponzi schemes.‚Äù Ouch, currency guys. Well, you can afford some very expensive salves for those burns. For now. For another point of view ‚Äî because I‚Äôm all about even-handedness, people! ‚Äî I checked with Jim Harper, executive vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and says the promise of Bitcoin is to create a payment system people can use anywhere in the world with privacy and security. He says its true value will be in commerce, not speculation. Well, that hasn‚Äôt happened yet; the price is too unstable. He said the currency will move beyond some of the early notorious uses in illegal commerce. As for the tulip comparisons, he joked, ‚ÄúLaugh all you want: My initial coin offering for cryptotulips will be worth billions!‚Äù I have discovered that the cryptocurrency revolution has reached my own family. My 22-year-old son told me that he had tried to buy a bit of a Bitcoin a few weeks ago and actually lost the money. It was his cash to spend, so there was no lecturing him about it. But I did ask why he had tried to invest in Bitcoin when he‚Äôs shown little interest in, say, mutual funds. He said that he had been unaware of the speculation in Bitcoin. Instead, he said, he was trying to use it for precisely what Mr. Harper says it will be best for: currency transactions with vendors who do not accept, for example, debit cards or PayPal. ‚ÄúWhat I was actually trying to do was buy porn,‚Äù he said patiently. ‚ÄúFrom Japan.‚Äù As I said, he‚Äôs a millennial, full of that generation‚Äôs bracing honesty. I‚Äôm glad he told me, but I sure don‚Äôt need to know more about the particular transaction, except for the clarifying fact that this vendor would take Bitcoin. He said he followed the instructions and created a ‚Äúwallet‚Äù and went to an exchange and, after entering a great deal of personal information, bought a small fraction of a bitcoin ‚Äî in fact, 0.005 of one, ‚Äúthe lowest quantity you could purchase‚Äù on the site. Then he found that he couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get to his money, grew frustrated and gave up. Well, I told him, losing 70 bucks is hardly ruinous; it‚Äôs more like the cost of an education. As we discussed the aborted transaction, he grabbed his laptop and took another look at the exchange site. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got in.‚Äù A calmer state of mind had led to success. The result? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 0.00545679 Bitcoin,‚Äù he said, reading off the screen, ‚Äúwhich is now worth ‚Ä¶ $96.‚Äù In the time the money had been locked up, it had jumped in value by about a third. ‚ÄúThis has been a profitable evening!‚Äù Tell me about it. In sheer percentage terms, his little investment outperformed my 401(k)‚Äôs return for an entire year. Now I am trying to figure out how to cash in on all of this, though without buying Bitcoin myself. It‚Äôs exactly the kind of market that a fool like me might be tempted to rush into, but I‚Äôve learned enough over the years to know that by the time I finally try the hot new thing, it is already cold and old. I am the maker of markets, the loser who helps to create winners. Instead, maybe I‚Äôll just pull a Long Island Iced Tea and change my name to Blockchain Schwartz. It has a nice ring to it! But that‚Äôs just a start. I think I‚Äôll write all of my articles from now on in an encrypted form and publish them via blockchain. This means, unfortunately, that no one will be able to read them. You may say that nobody can read your stuff anyway! You can be cruel, reader. But I say that the exclusivity and security built into my cryptoprose will make each article surge in value.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Sports of The Times By Michael Powell For one night in what most likely is a lost cause of a series, Big Poison and Little Poison utterly dominated an N.B.A. finals game and caused a lake city to wonder what if. LeBron James was Big Poison, draining 3-pointers like a certain little point guard with an errant mouthpiece, and threading off-the-dribble passes like Magic Johnson. Kyrie Irving was Little Poison, doing his herky-jerky Earl the Pearl routine. Watching him embark on jaunts toward the hoop called to mind a city player who knows every dead spot on a backboard, the better to make a back-spinning ball fall through a netless hoop. James offered his usual otherworldly statistics, 31 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds, while Irving scored 40 points on moves that had defenders hurrying to the bench to dial their chiropractor. Both men broke the 40-minutes-played barrier. The shame of it was that this madcap medicine show in Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals on Friday night was most likely a one-off, an alternative-universe tease. As superbly as the Cleveland Cavaliers played, as talented as were the two Poisons, the Golden State Warriors remain freakishly outfitted with passers and shooters and rebounders, and, more to the point, the Oakland team still holds a three-games-to-one series lead. (Big and Little Poison, for connoisseurs of the obscure, were two Baseball Hall of Fame brothers who played a very long time ago.) Marc Skelton, one of New York‚Äôs best high school basketball coaches, has made note of the sheer basketball I.Q. of this Warriors team. If this were 1958, he noted on Twitter, the Warriors would be driving Ferrari 250GT Europas while the rest of the league puttered around in Edsels. In truth, though, the Cavaliers nearly matched the Warriors in passing acuity this year ‚Äî players on both teams touch the ball the shortest possible time before passing it on. To analyze those statistics, or to listen to the players afterward, was to feel sorrow that this series turned competitive only these past two games. In Game 3, the Cavaliers ruined a fine effort by collapsing in the final minutes. But in Game 4 they came out hair-afire, piling up ridiculous point totals and playing with abandon. Any Warrior foolish enough to go airborne near the basket risked getting spun like a top to the floor. It was a measure of the game‚Äôs intensity that you turned around and saw James and Kevin Durant, 1a and 1b for best player in the Milky Way, and two self-possessed fellows, jawing furiously with each other during a break in the game. Sweaty urgency had seized them in its embrace, even though neither man is a natural smack talker. Asked about it afterward, Durant, who scored 35 points, smiled faintly and suggested that they might have been exchanging shooting tips. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt coming to blows,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe were just talking.‚Äù In fact, the contest took on a ragged look at times, and reminded you how America‚Äôs beautiful game attempts to sabotage itself. The referees had an off night, even forgetting which malefactor player had how many technical fouls. And the real shame is that the N.B.A., under the modern illusion that we can make the imperfect perfect, once again allowed replays to slow a riveting game to a crawl. There have been other annoyances, too. After Game 3, some writers unearthed a tired trope and suggested that James, in the final minute, had blundered by passing the ball to Kyle Korver, who proceeded to miss a 3-pointer. A true star, they said, ‚Äî by which they meant Michael Jordan ‚Äî would have driven into the grill of the Warriors‚Äô defense and shot the ball himself. This is a silly parlor game that misapprehends James‚Äôs gifts, which have never been those of a pure scorer. He has a body armored with muscle and sinew, and he can leap to eye level with the hoop, but his genius is his ability to see the floor in five dimensions. ‚ÄúI had 101 drives last night,‚Äù he told reporters facetiously that night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt go for 102.‚Äù A reporter pressed his point and James responded by pressing his counterpoint. ‚ÄúIf I could have the play over again, I would come off a three-screen situation. Draymond would switch on me with five fouls, I would get him leaning. I would drive left. I would see K.D. step up.‚Äù James went on like this, doing his best Hubie Brown imitation. And he finished: ‚ÄúAnd I would see Kyle Korver in the corner, one of the greatest 3-point shooters in this league‚Äôs history.‚Äù He smiled at the reporter. ‚ÄúAnd I would do the same exact thing.‚Äù After Game 4, reporters again surrounded James like so many saffron-robe devotees ‚Äôround their swami. They noted that last year Cleveland had also trailed the Warriors three games to one, but came back to win the championship, an epic feat, to which the Warriors responded by adding the 7-foot Durant to their deadly lineup. Do you, a reporter asked, have the Warriors where you want them? James looked quizzically at the reporter, as if to imply that perhaps he had been smoking something. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthey got us where they want us.‚Äù Another reporter tried a roundabout way into the same question. What is it that allows you to respond so well to such dire circumstances? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it. It causes too much stress, man. I‚Äôm stressed out.‚Äù Who wouldn‚Äôt be? The Cavaliers, after their 137-116 victory, were still just one loss from being former champions, and they had to travel back to Oakland for Game 5, where the fans will scream like banshees and the Warriors will do their pass-and-shoot-and-smile hocus-pocus. If I bet money, I‚Äôd look for Cleveland to get lowered into its grave Monday night. I‚Äôd also advise the Warriors to take care of business. Because they don‚Äôt want to breathe any more life into their still wounded rival. Email: powellm@nytimes.com    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSAPRIL 26, 2018, 1:28 P.M. E.D.T.  WASHINGTON ‚Äî  Less than three weeks ago, Ty Lawson was playing professional basketball in China. Nowadays, he's one of the first subs off the bench for the Washington Wizards in their Eastern Conference first-round series against the Toronto Raptors. Lawson is hardly the only player who went from not having a spot on an NBA roster to getting some run, and maybe even filling a key role, during these playoffs. As much as teams develop plans for acquiring talent via the draft, free agency or trades, sometimes a late pickup can become a piece that completes the puzzle. ""It's not ideal,"" Wizards coach Scott Brooks said about adding someone on short notice. ""It (requires) a lot of work that has to be done in trying to figure it out and try to incorporate him and integrate him into our offense and defensive schemes."" With Lawson, though, Brooks added, ""It probably is not as much of a disadvantage because he's been in the league, understands the NBA and understands the schemes. A lot of the schemes are the same. It's just different names and a lot of the plays are the same but different names. He picks up things pretty quick. His IQ level is extremely high."" Advertisement The series, which the Raptors lead 3-2 heading into Game 6 on Friday, has been Lawson's first NBA action in about a year. He was with the Sacramento Kings last season and spent time with three other clubs before that; Lawson was always a success on the court, although a couple of arrests in 2015 on drunken driving charges drew unwanted attention. Advertisement His sudden return to the league's hardwoods came in Game 2 against Toronto, when Brooks turned to his 30-year-old backup and told him to replace All-Star John Wall. ""It was a little bit of a shock. ... I was like, 'Who?'"" Lawson said. ""Once I got my feet wet, hit my first shot, I felt like I was back at home."" Sure looks that way. The guard, a 2009 first-round draft pick, is averaging 5.8 points, 3.8 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 19 minutes per game, and he's made a total of only three turnovers for the Wizards. ""That's a smaller version of John Wall. He's so quick. ... Push the pace. Get out in transition,"" Wizards forward Otto Porter Jr. said. ""Someone you can't sleep on. He might be small, but he can create a lot of havoc in the paint. A lot of us know Ty, just from playing against him, so it wasn't nothing to get him acquainted with everybody."" There have been other such easy fits. For all the talk about the Philadelphia 76ers' ""process"" that landed cornerstone stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, for example, they moved into the East semifinals with notable contributions against the Miami Heat from two more impromptu arrivals, 3-point specialist Marco Belinelli and forward Ersan Ilyasova.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. The team signed both in February after they were sent packing by worst-in-the-East Atlanta. Belinelli is averaging 16.6 points in the playoffs, while Ilyasova is putting up 10.8 points and 9.2 rebounds, including three of his five career 10-rebound games. When the 76ers picked up Ilyasova, they waived Trevor Booker, who then went to the Indiana Pacers. Booker has added a physical presence for Indiana in its series against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. As Oklahoma City faces the Utah Jazz, the Thunder are starting Corey Brewer, who was brought in last month after he was bought out by the Los Angeles Lakers. Greg Monroe, added by the Celtics after being bought out by Phoenix, entered Thursday night's Game 6 of Boston's series against the Milwaukee Bucks averaging 7.0 points and 5.2 rebounds. Advertisement Even former league MVP Derrick Rose became available out of nowhere, signing with the Timberwolves in March. As part of a reserve unit that had been quiet most of the season, he offered some instant offense in Minnesota's first-round loss to the Houston Rockets. For the Wizards, Lawson stepped in as a reliable and experienced backup to Wall. ""We need his scoring, we need his playmaking, we need his toughness, we need his ability to get into the paint,"" Brooks said. ""And he plays with no fear."" Lawson crammed for his debut by watching Washington's main plays on an iPad, learning about 60 to 70 percent of the offense that way. In his first game, he'd ask a teammate to let the basketball bounce on an inbound pass so Lawson would have a moment to ask Brooks which play to run. But Lawson also relied on a simple mindset. ""I was like, 'Be aggressive,'"" he said, ""'and we'll figure it out.'"" ___ AP Sports Writers Cliff Brunt, Dave Campbell, Dan Gelston, Kyle Hightower and Michael Marot contributed to this report. ___ More AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Richard Goldstein Hal Greer, the Hall of Fame guard with the dazzling jump shot who helped take the Philadelphia 76ers to the 1967 N.B.A. championship, died on Saturday night in Arizona. He was 81. The 76ers announced his death on the team‚Äôs website but did not specify the cause or say where in Arizona he died. A consistently prolific scorer, Greer was one of the most brilliant pro guards of the 1960s, together with Oscar Robertson, Jerry West and Sam Jones. But he was always low key. Greer was a slightly built 6 feet 2 inches. He wasn‚Äôt a leaper, he had no special flash, and he seldom showed emotion on the court. ‚ÄúI never said anything that made headlines,‚Äù he told Basketball Digest in 1980. ‚ÄúNothing colorful.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe called Greer bulldog because he had that kind of expression on his face, and it never changed,‚Äù his former teammate Al Bianchi told Terry Pluto in the oral history ‚ÄúTall Tales‚Äù (1992). But in his 15 N.B.A. seasons, with the Syracuse Nationals and their successor franchise, the 76ers, Greer turned in an outstanding game just about every night. Earl Monroe, who faced Greer while playing for the Baltimore Bullets and the Knicks, recalled how Greer would pile up points in an unspectacular but devastating way. ‚ÄúHe would have 25 or 30 points on you, and you‚Äôd be wondering what he did to get all those points,‚Äù Monroe recalled in ‚ÄúEarl the Pearl‚Äù (2013, with Quincy Troupe). ‚ÄúEvery night, steady. You knew he would be going to pull up and shoot the jumper, but you were never ready for it.‚Äù Averaging more than 20 points a game in eight seasons, Greer was an N.B.A. All-Star from 1961 to 1970, and he was named to the all-league second team seven times. He was voted most valuable player of the 1968 All-Star Game, scoring a record 19 points in a single quarter. He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982 and named to the N.B.A.‚Äôs 50th anniversary team in 1996. Greer averaged 22.1 points a game on the 76ers‚Äô 1967 championship squad, playing alongside Wilt Chamberlain at center, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Billy Cunningham at forward, and Larry Costello and Wally (later Wali) Jones in the backcourt. The 76ers, coached by Alex Hannum, were 68-13 in the regular season, then eliminated the Bill Russell-led Celtics from the playoffs with a 4-games-to-1 victory in the Eastern Division finals, ending Boston‚Äôs streak of eight consecutive N.B.A. titles. Philadelphia won the finals over the San Francisco Warriors in six games. Greer averaged nearly 28 points a game in the 76ers‚Äô 15 playoff games. Cunningham long remembered Greer‚Äôs one-handed jumper, fired from up to 20 feet out, usually from the top of the foul circle. As he told Hoop magazine in 2006, it was ‚Äúas good as anybody‚Äôs who ever played the game.‚Äù Greer was also adept at penetrating to the basket, and he was an outstanding defensive player. He shot free throws effectively while mimicking his jump-shooting form. ‚ÄúI would like to be remembered as a great, consistent player,‚Äù he once told The Philadelphia Daily News. Harold Everett Greer was born on June 26, 1936, in Huntington, W. Va., where his father, William, was a railroad worker. After starring at the segregated Frederick Douglass High School there, he became the first high-profile black player at a major college in West Virginia, averaging more than 19 points a game for Marshall College (now Marshall University) in Huntington. Earl Lloyd, the first black player in the N.B.A., with the Washington Capitols in 1950, played at the historically black West Virginia State. The Syracuse Nationals selected Greer in the second round of the 1958 N.B.A. draft. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think I had a chance at all,‚Äù he once said. ‚ÄúWhen I first got there, I didn‚Äôt even unpack my bag.‚Äù But Greer went on to team with the outstanding front-count scorers Dolph Schayes, Johnny Kerr and George Yardley and played five seasons for the Nationals before they became the Philadelphia 76ers, after the Philadelphia Warriors moved to San Francisco. Although Greer enjoyed his greatest success with the 76ers, there were some low points as well. With five seconds left in Game 7 of the 1965 Eastern Division finals and the 76ers trailing the Celtics by 1 point, Greer inbounded the ball. His high, soft toss to Walker was deflected by Boston‚Äôs John Havlicek as the Celtic broadcaster Johnny Most memorably screamed: ‚ÄúHavlicek stole the ball! It‚Äôs all over!‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt put enough on the ball,‚Äù Greer told The Boston Globe afterward. In his final season, Greer was a substitute on a famously awful team, the 1972-73 Sixers, who went 9-73. Over his career he scored 21,586 points for an average of 19.2 a game and played in 1,122 games, an N.B.A. record at the time of his retirement. He owned a marketing company after leaving basketball. He and his wife, Mayme, had two daughters, Cherie and Kelly, and a son, Hal Jr. The 76ers said all survive him. Greer may have been a steady and quiet sort, but one night in the fall of 1967 he showed a thing or two to a Knicks rookie who would come to epitomize flash. ‚ÄúHe was one of my heroes, probably my favorite player,‚Äù Walt Frazier wrote in recalling his first preseason appearance in ‚ÄúThe Game Within the Game‚Äù (2006, with Dan Markowitz). ‚ÄúBut that night he just killed me. He beat me off the dribble, he pulled up for 15-foot jumpers. When the locker room cleared out, I sat down and cried. I really didn‚Äôt think I had what it took to make it in the N.B.A.‚Äù Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Technology,"Advertisement By REUTERSAPRIL 30, 2018, 4:46 P.M. E.D.T.  (Reuters) - Insurer Beazley has partnered with three companies to build a blockchain-based registry that will manage insurance for crisis situations such as mass shootings, the companies told Reuters. The registry will use blockchain to speed a response to mass casualties and their financial aftermath by allowing policyholders and insurers to catalogue coverage and share real-time information about threats and claims through one source, the companies said. The registry is created with Risk Cooperative, a Washington, D.C.-based speciality insurance broker that develops Lloyd's of London-backed programs, and Amsterdam-based Bitfury Group, a blockchain technology firm, and it is nearing completion, said Risk Cooperative Chief Executive Officer Dante Disparte in an interview. A fourth company, Emercoin, is providing blockchain infrastructure for the registry. Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, is the technology underpinning the first digital currency, bitcoin. But it can also be harnessed to track, record and transfer assets across all industries. Advertisement The registry is an early example of using blockchain for insurance. Many insurance industry leaders envision ""smart"" policies of all types will be stored in blockchain and  automatically track premiums, pay claims and keep records. Advertisement Many companies still manually record on spreadsheets their annual policies and coverage limits, a practice that can heighten the risk of human error. Violent events that spur mass casualties, such as an Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people at a country music festival and injured hundreds more, can involve numerous insurance policy holders and thousands of claims.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Policy exclusions or having too little coverage can leave communities and victims unable to cover expenses, but those gaps are easier to spot through a permanent blockchain ledger, Disparte said. The partner companies are next planning to develop so-called ""smart"" policies for violent acts, to be permanently stored in the registry. They will be programmed to automatically kick in when a mass casualty occurs, eliminating claims paperwork for policyholders and trimming months from the settlement process, they said. Service providers, such as security experts and counselors,  would be automatically be dispatched when an event is under way. The companies plan to store other types of existing policies for customers who buy mass casualty coverage, Disparte said. The registry will also eliminate time-consuming audits by underwriters because transactions will be recorded in one place.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by corner office She grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she‚Äôs running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up, and she got stuff done.  By David Gelles It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn‚Äôt been the case for her.  Ms. Friedman, the chief executive of Nasdaq, grew up around finance, and knew from an early age that she wanted to work in the industry. Joining Nasdaq in 1993, Ms. Friedman rose through the ranks, serving as head of corporate strategy and ultimately taking over as chief financial officer in 2009. She left to become the C.F.O. of the Carlyle Group, a major private equity firm, but returned to Nasdaq, becoming chief executive last year.  Today, Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq‚Äôs culture more collaborative, grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She‚Äôs also overseeing Nasdaq‚Äôs continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world.  This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Nasdaq‚Äôs MarketSite location in Times Square. Tell me about your parents.  My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls.  My parents got married when they were still in college, so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids, but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9, she decided to go to law school, and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person, and my dad was really, really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me, to see how she transformed herself. You were in all-girls schools until college. How did that shape you?  It was a really important part of me growing up, being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life.  I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up, and our science teacher ‚Äî who was a man ‚Äî said: ‚ÄúO.K., well, let‚Äôs work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.‚Äù It was not at all like, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs hard.‚Äù It was more like, ‚ÄúGreat, let‚Äôs get you well positioned to be able to do that.‚Äù Did you always want to get into finance? I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of ‚ÄúOf course your congressman‚Äôs going to represent all of your interests.‚Äù I came away saying, ‚ÄúWow, progress is slow.‚Äù What drew you to Wall Street? In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager, you have to own the four P‚Äôs of marketing ‚Äî product, placement, pricing and promotion. If you own the product, it‚Äôs like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn‚Äôt think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods, but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq. You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then?  There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do, and I would go do it, and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done. When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôll be gone for three months, and you‚Äôll come back.‚Äù He really just didn‚Äôt even factor it into his decision making. What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren‚Äôt receiving equal treatment? First of all, make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me, and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside, and I said: ‚ÄúSpeak up. You are really, really smart. No more mousy voice.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters NEW YORK ‚Äî Gold and diamond companies including Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Richline Group Inc joined with IBM to develop blockchain technology to track the origin of jewelry and ensure it is ethically sourced, the companies said on Thursday. The joint initiative dubbed TrustChain aims to make it easier for consumers to track diamonds and precious metals through the various steps of the supply chain as they become finished pieces jewelry, the companies said. The technology will initially help track six styles of diamond and gold engagement rings and is expected to be available to consumers by the end of 2018, the companies said. Other firms involved in the initiative include precious metals refiner Asahi Refining, jewelry retailer Helzberg Diamonds, precious metals supplier LeachGarner and third-party verification provider UL.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet. Because it makes it easier for multiple parties to jointly create and update tamper-proof records, the firms involved in the project believe it is well suited to securely and efficiently track and prove the origin and ethical sourcing of jewelry. Richline Group had previously attempted to create a similar database using different technology, but the process was still heavily manual and prone to inaccuracies, Mark Hanna, the company's chief marketing officer, said in an interview. ""We were always very enamored with it but there wasn't the right platform,"" Hanna said. ""Then along came blockchain."" The TrustChain platform was tested last week to track the provenance of a diamond ring across the supply chain.  Other companies in the industry have started to explore using blockchain technology. Anglo American's diamond unit De Beers said in January that it aims to create an industry wide blockchain to track gems each time they change hands starting from the moment they are dug from the ground. [L8N1PB4GZ] Companies in other sectors have also been seeking to adapt blockchain help simplify and reduce the costs some of their most data processes. Supply chain management is one of the areas where businesses believe blockchain holds the most promise, as it involves numerous parties and is still very manual. IBM is also working with large food retail companies on a blockchain platform to help track food supply chains and improve safety.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by fact check The president‚Äôs claims about enormous trade deficits, tariffs and the World Trade Organization are overstated and contradicted by his own economic report. By Linda Qiu This was updated on March 7, 2018. In defending his embrace of steep tariffs ‚Äî and in comments that seem to encourage a trade war ‚Äî President Trump has repeatedly claimed enormous trade imbalances, unfair practices and an international system that benefits everyone but the United States. Mr. Trump‚Äôs promises to fix the problems he has identified through an aggressive trade agenda has appeared to unnerve markets, which fell when they opened on Wednesday. The dip came after Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, announced on Tuesday his plans to resign amid an internal White House struggle over Mr. Trump‚Äôs plan to impose large tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.  Regardless, Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade claims are often overstated and contradicted by his own economic council. Here is a fact-check of recent comments that Mr. Trump has made on trade deficits, the World Trade Organization and tariffs.  From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again!  #MAGA From January 1989 to January 2018, the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States has decreased by about 5.5 million. There also were about 77,000 fewer domestic manufacturing factories, workshops and what the Census Bureau terms as ‚Äúestablishments‚Äù in 2014 ‚Äî the latest year with available data ‚Äî than in 1989. But it‚Äôs not accurate to attribute all of these declines to trade, even if globalization clearly did contribute. Economists say technology had a role to play, too. As New York Times reporter Claire Cain Miller has written for the Upshot, multiple studies have found that industries like steel, computers and electronics were hit hard by automation.  Mr. Trump has cited this figure more than 50 times since 2015.  A White House spokesman said the $800 billion deficit figure that Mr. Trump has cited refers to the trade balance in goods. The Department of Commerce reported a $810 billion deficit in goods in 2017, but a total trade deficit of $566 billion that includes a trade surplus in services.  Mr. Trump‚Äôs preoccupation with trade in goods contradicts his own White House economic report, which he signed and was released in February. The United States‚Äô economy has shifted ‚Äúaway from manufacturing and toward service provision industries‚Äù in recent decades, according the report. ‚ÄúFocusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States‚Äô comparative advantage in services.‚Äù  Like most developed countries, the United States is primarily a services economy, said Scott Lincicome, a trade analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. And American service sectors ‚Äî like accounting, finance, technology, engineering and law ‚Äî are globally dominant.  ‚ÄúBy focusing only on goods, you make it seem far weaker than it actually is,‚Äù Mr. Lincicome said. Doing so also means ‚Äúignoring a large, growing and vibrant part of the economy,‚Äù he said.  Even if Mr. Trump is referring only to the trade deficit in goods, he is off by more than $100 billion. The Commerce Department reported a deficit of $375 billion in goods with China in 2017. Overall, the United States had a net deficit of $309 billion in 2016.  In fact, the United States had a total trade surplus of $7.7 billion with Canada in 2016, and a surplus of $4.4 billion through the third quarter of 2017.  ‚ÄúMassive‚Äù is a matter of opinion, but the United States did have a trade deficit of $63 billion with Mexico in 2016, and $52.2 billion through the third quarter of 2017. The European Union imposes a 10 percent tariff on American-made cars, while the United States‚Äô tariff against imported European cars is just 2.5 percent. But that doesn‚Äôt mean American cars are ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to sell in Europe. The United States is the third largest car exporter in the world, sending almost 70,000 cars to Britain, France, Norway and Switzerland in 2014, according to the Commerce Department. The Observatory of Economic Complexity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the United States exported $11.8 billion in cars to Europe in 2016. Actually, the United States had a trade surplus with five out of 15 major trading partners in 2016, including Brazil ($22 billion), Singapore ($18 billion) and Britain ($14.7 billion). Mr. Trump‚Äôs economic report also cautioned against counting trade deficits as losses or as a metric of economic health. It argued that deficits reflect myriad factors, including the strength of the dollar.  ‚ÄúThe United States has been able to sustain a trade deficit in part because of the role of the U.S. dollar in the global economy,‚Äù according to the report. ‚ÄúForeigners are happy to hold U.S. dollars and dollar-denominated assets, which they obtain by selling more goods and services to Americans than they buy.‚Äù  And as The New York Times‚Äô economic correspondent Jim Tankersley has reported:  ‚ÄúMost economists do not see the trade gap as money ‚Äòlost‚Äô to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That‚Äôs because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America‚Äôs trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.‚Äù Mr. Trump slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels in January. He appears to have mixed up the rates for the two products.  Solar panels face a 30 percent tariff. The first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported in 2018 face a 20 percent tariff; that levy grows to 50 percent against every machine afterward that comes into the United States. Those penalties are gradually phased down in the second and third year of the three-year tariff program. Complaints by Whirlpool Inc. about its Korean competitors prompted the White House action. It has since said it added 200 jobs to a plant in Ohio in anticipation of demand resulting from the tariffs. It has not announced construction of any new plants.  Samsung and LG Electronics have said they will accelerate plans to open plants in the United States following the tariff announcement. But Samsung announced its plans to build a factory in South Carolina last June and LG said it would build a new facility in Tennessee in February 2017.  Mr. Trump‚Äôs claims of bias are contradicted by his own economic report.  The United States has won more cases than the global average. According to the White House report, ‚Äúthe United States has won 85.7 percent of the cases it has initiated before the W.T.O. since 1995, compared with a global average of 84.4 percent. In contrast, China‚Äôs success rate is just 66.7 percent.‚Äù  In cases where the United States is the respondent, ‚Äúit still wins 25 percent of the time, a rate that is better than the global average rate of 16.6 percent,‚Äù the report noted. That rate is far better than the rates of the European Union and Japan (which have never won a case brought against them) and China (which has won only 5.3 percent of the time).

Politics,"Advertisement By DANNY HAKIM and MATTHEW ROSENBERGMARCH 17, 2018  When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month, Alexander Nix did not hesitate. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never worked in Russia,‚Äù said Mr. Nix, head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters. ‚ÄúAs far as I‚Äôm aware, we‚Äôve never worked for a Russian company,‚Äù Mr. Nix added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we don‚Äôt have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.‚Äù But Mr. Nix‚Äôs business did have some dealings with Russian interests, according to company documents and interviews. Advertisement Mr. Nix is a director of SCL Group, a British political and defense contractor, and chief executive of its American offshoot, Cambridge Analytica, which advised the Trump campaign. The firms‚Äô employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant. Advertisement Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London. The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States ‚Äî and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters‚Äô behavior. Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what ‚Äî or which client ‚Äî prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin‚Äôs popularity to Russian expansionism. On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm‚Äôs elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done ‚Äúcommercial work‚Äù about 25 years ago ‚Äúfor a private company in Russia.‚Äù Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election. While Mr. Nix‚Äôs firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. ‚ÄúIt is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,‚Äù they said in a report this month. Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm‚Äôs commercial division ‚Äúdiscussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.‚Äù The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired. Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

No contracts were signed.‚Äù Advertisement But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company‚Äôs voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters. ‚ÄúI remember being super confused,‚Äù said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings. ‚ÄúI kept asking Alexander, ‚ÄòCan you explain to me what they want?‚Äô‚Äù he said, referring to Mr. Nix. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sending them stuff about political targeting ‚Äî they then come and ask more about political targeting,‚Äù Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil ‚Äújust didn‚Äôt seem to be interested‚Äù in how the techniques could be used commercially. Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company. A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie‚Äôs account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement. Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Letters To the Editor: Re ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Hopes for Relief Under a Trump Presidency Backfire Spectacularly‚Äù (news analysis, July 31): I strongly disagree. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is playing the long game, a game that Trump and Company cannot even understand. I have believed all along that Mr. Putin‚Äôs goal was never to put a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù in the White House. Rather, it has always been to disrupt and weaken the United States and our democracy. What better way to do this than to help put an inexperienced, incompetent narcissist and his cronies in charge of our country? Mr. Putin is succeeding, even beyond his dreams. There has been no backfire. EUGENE A. SCANLANSECHELT, BRITISH COLUMBIA To the Editor: President Vladimir V. Putin is more prescient than your news analysis gives him credit for. Since Inauguration Day, the White House has been nothing but tumultuous infighting, a series of high-profile ousters (or resignations), and innumerable scandals, not all of which involve Russia. Congress has no significant legislative achievements; Syria remains mired in brutal conflict; North Korea is closer than ever to establishing itself as a serious nuclear power; and Donald Trump has spent more than 20 percent of his days as president playing golf. To suggest that Russia has not achieved anything here is shortsighted. While the world laughs at the latest gaffe in the White House, Russia has comfort in knowing that much of the spotlight is diverted to Mr. Trump. Putting aside the freedom this gives Mr. Putin to achieve his own geopolitical goals, this in and of itself is a victory for him and for Russia. COLIN WOLFGANG, JERSEY CITY To the Editor: It is ironic that Donald Trump has always puffed himself up as a great negotiator, when in fact skilled negotiation is exactly and urgently what we need at this moment in global history, regarding North Korea especially, but many others, too, along with other challenges. THOMAS PITONIAKWESTFIELD, MASS. To the Editor: There is only one good thing Donald Trump has ever done, and that was to try to increase d√©tente with Russia. Now, forces within the United States, not least the Democratic Party, have driven the reimposition of sanctions on Russia. Russia in fact is very weak, but it does possess nuclear arms, like the United States. And it does have legitimate fear that NATO‚Äôs advance toward its border could threaten it. This new cold war is a game that could end with the annihilation of life on earth. ELLEN CANTAROW, NEW YORK Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman Bad policies sometimes lead to interesting economics. For example, the disastrous turn toward austerity after 2009 was a kind of natural experiment that led to an upwelling of good work on the effects of fiscal policy. And I‚Äôm starting to think that the Trumpian trade war, which finally seems to have arrived, will lead to some good work on international economic policy. Like the work on fiscal policy, it will of course be ignored by people in power. But still worth doing. In this little essay I‚Äôm going to offer some analysis and a few numbers based on a chain of thought that begins with Trump‚Äôs evident disdain for Japan and ends up in Atlanta, New Orleans, and Buffalo. What? Bear with me if you have a taste for things wonkish. My starting point is a peculiar aspect of Trump‚Äôs climb-down on steel tariffs. The ostensible justification for these tariffs was national security; but as was widely noted from the start ‚Äì although this probably came as news to the Trumpies ‚Äì most U.S. steel imports come from American allies. And now Trump has granted exemptions to allies that largely vitiate the supposed point of the exercise. One country that has conspicuously not been granted an exemption, however, is Japan. Why not? One answer may be that the Japanese aren‚Äôt, you know, white. Another answer may be that Trump, who often seems to have fixed ideas about the world that are long out of date ‚Äì like his belief that American cities are gripped by a huge crime wave ‚Äì is still living in the Michael Crichton era when Japan was going to take over the world any day now. Yet a third answer may be that the U.S. does run a trade deficit with Japan ‚Äì actually even bigger than the headline number if you include Japanese components embedded in Chinese exports ‚Äì and Trump believes that (a) a trade deficit means that you‚Äôre losing while someone else is winning and (b) trade balances are determined by protectionism. Both propositions are, of course, untrue. In reality, trade balances are the flip side of capital flows: countries that attract more inflows of foreign capital than their own outflows must, by the sheer arithmetic, run current account deficits (that is, including investment income). Conversely, countries that are exporters of capital run current account surpluses. And modern Japan is a country that really should be running current account surpluses, for one powerful reason: demography. Japan has a rapidly declining working age population: This means limited opportunities for investment, which means that it‚Äôs a country that should be investing its savings abroad. But the claim that trade surpluses often reflect weakness, while trade deficits reflect strength, is a very hard sell. And demographic drivers of trade imbalances are usually a lot less clear than this. This, however, got me thinking: what about regions within the United States? We have sharply different growth rates across metropolitan areas, mainly driven by in- or out-migration. There are no protectionist barriers to muddy the picture, and capital is surely highly mobile within the country. Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have comprehensive regional balance of payments data. Thanks to researchers at Brookings, however, we do now have a lot of information on the exports and imports of metropolitan areas ‚Äì exports and imports to and from other parts of the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. I‚Äôm not sure how safe it is to use these data to estimate trade balances, but let me take a stab at it. These data only cover goods; they don‚Äôt cover either services or income transfers like, say, Social Security receipts, which as we‚Äôll see in a second can make a big difference. So I don‚Äôt think I can run any regressions here. But I still think looking at metropolitan trade balances can be enlightening. So let‚Äôs look at the metros with the biggest goods trade deficits and surpluses. First, the biggest deficits (data for 2010, in billions of dollars): Washington: -$86 billion Miami: -$68 billion San Francisco: -$41 billion Atlanta: -$35 billion Baltimore: -$33 billion OK, Washington runs a huge deficit in goods; basically, what it exports is garbage. No, literally: waste is the only product in which it runs a surplus. But this goods deficit is presumably offset by services, both the federal budget and stuff like payments to K Street lobbyists. My guess is that Baltimore has some of the same stuff. Miami, meanwhile, is selling warm weather to senior citizens, who live largely off Social Security and Medicare. The big deficit surprise here to someone with a Trumpist view of trade balances would surely be Atlanta, which has been one of our fastest-growing metropolitan areas: a 24 percent increase in population between 2000 and 2010. And we‚Äôre talking about a big deficit ‚Äì about 13 percent of metro GDP. What‚Äôs that about? The answer, surely, is that the deficit is a reflection of Atlanta‚Äôs growth: we‚Äôre talking about building lots of housing, office parks, and so on, and much of that is financed by capital inflows from the rest of the country. Next, the biggest surpluses: Los Angeles: +$63 billion Memphis: +$29 billion Greensboro: +$18 billion Corpus Christi: +$18 billion New Orleans: +$15 billion Los Angeles is a very big metropolitan area, but also one whose growth has slowed a lot: it has run out of land, and zoning restrictions have kept it from building up. So its population rose only 3.7 percent from 2000 to 2010. As a result, it has probably become a big exporter of excess savings, hence a city with big trade surpluses, around 9 percent of GDP (probably even bigger if we had data on services). I haven‚Äôt done enough homework to know what‚Äôs going on in the middle three here. But did you know that New Orleans runs huge trade surpluses? And I mean huge: almost 20 percent of GDP in 2010. Now, I don‚Äôt think many people would consider New Orleans an economic winner. In fact, its population declined 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, partly because of Katrina, but also because of wider problems. And that very decline means that savings generated in New Orleans go elsewhere in search of returns. You can see the same thing in smaller cities with declining populations. Buffalo-Niagara Falls saw a 3 percent population decline in the 2000s; in 2010 it ran a trade surplus of 22 percent of GDP. And what about the Big Apple? Greater New York ran a small goods trade deficit ‚Äì 1.6 percent of GDP ‚Äì in 2010, but thanks to the financial industry surely ran a huge surplus in services. (Remember, this is the metro area, not just New York, so there are plenty of goods exports from, say, the pharma complex in New Jersey.) So it‚Äôs a big surplus economy overall ‚Äì not because it‚Äôs growing fast, but because despite immigration its overall population is growing slowly. So to sum things up: within the United States we have large regional trade imbalances that don‚Äôt reflect ‚Äúunfair‚Äù trade policies, because interstate trade is totally free. And running trade surpluses isn‚Äôt a sign of success, nor is running deficits a sign of failure. If anything, much of the time it‚Äôs the reverse: fast-growing regions run deficits, stagnating regions run surpluses. The same principles apply at the international level. And I‚Äôm sure experts in the Trump administration will explain to the president why his view of such things is all wrong. Oh, wait. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Letters To the Editor:  ‚ÄúMr. Trump‚Äôs Empty Words on Trade‚Äù (editorial, March 12) asserts that President Trump‚Äôs announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports ‚Äúshould worry everyone concerned about a trade war or the health of the steel and aluminum industries.‚Äù Yes, we all understand the ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù orthodoxy that a country benefits from having no tariffs even if its trading partner imposes tariffs on imports into its own country. But it is equally true that both countries benefit even more if neither country imposes tariffs. Economic theory does not teach how to persuade your trading partner to lower or eliminate its own tariffs. That is the art of diplomacy and negotiation, and President Trump, to his credit, appears to recognize that trade policy is one of the tools in his chest to achieve desired ends in trade and other international relations. After decades of ballooning United States trade deficits under a free trade regime, maybe we should give the president a chance to experiment with his fair trade policy before questioning its ‚Äî and his ‚Äî wisdom. KURT M. HEYMANWILMINGTON, DEL. To the Editor: Alexander Hamilton was a believer in tariffs, but if he were President Trump‚Äôs treasury secretary, he would have resigned in disgust. Hamilton argued that the only way the fledgling United States economy could ever hope to compete with the more advanced British economy was to place tariffs to protect ‚Äúinfant industries‚Äù in the United States. However, he was quite clear to add that when the protected industries ‚Äúmatured,‚Äù the tariffs should be removed to place competitive pressure on the American industries (to keep prices down). Tariffs protect inefficient domestic industries, and retaliatory tariffs by those countries hurt by our tariffs are levied on our most efficient industries ‚Äî those industries able to compete on international markets. The effect then of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs is to subsidize inefficiency and to penalize efficiency. Where does that get the United States economy in the long run? JOHN KIRK, REDWOOD CITY, CALIF. The writer is a retired professor of economics. To the Editor: What if instead of imposing tariffs on specific goods we imposed ‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call them ‚Äúsanctions‚Äù for the sake of this argument? These sanctions would not allow into the United States, at least not without penalty, specified goods that had been produced under conditions that would be illegal in the United States. Factors such as working conditions, wages and pollution could all be criteria. Tariffs tend to benefit few. These rules could benefit many. Their adoption could greatly benefit workers in the United States by not giving a competitive advantage to foreign companies that underpay workers, and could benefit workers abroad by promoting safer conditions and living wages. The sanctions could also provide the teeth needed to enforce pollution standards on the world stage. SARAH PALCHER, PASADENA, CALIF. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Lan Cao Ms. Cao is a professor of international economic law. The escalating trade war between the United States and China, with the Trump administration considering $100 billion in punitive tariffs in response to China‚Äôs $50 billion in retaliatory tariffs, obscures a more important source of conflict: China‚Äôs desire to someday establish the yuan as a global reserve currency, on a par with the dollar. The dollar‚Äôs status is inextricably linked to international trade. Because the dollar reigns supreme in the trading system, other countries need to accumulate dollars. Most international trade is conducted using the dollar, even if the United States is not a party to the transaction. The United States wasn‚Äôt always so dominant. After the 1971 decision to end the link between the value of the dollar and gold reserves, the dollar became a currency much like any other. But in 1974, the United States and Saudi Arabia struck an agreement in which the Saudis and the other Gulf states supported the dollar as the primary medium of exchange for oil exports. Thus, oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so any country that buys oil must build up its dollar reserves to pay for it ‚Äî mostly by exporting its goods and services so that it can receive dollars as payment. Once established as a global reserve currency, the dollar has been kept strong by sustained demand for it, and a strong dollar makes American exports expensive to the rest of the world. American exports decline, imports increase, and a result is the trade deficit. Testifying before Congress in 1960, the economist Robert Triffin observed that the dollar‚Äôs global reserve status depends on the willingness of the United States to run trade deficits. This relationship, known as Triffin‚Äôs Dilemma, doesn‚Äôt always hold true (other countries have had reserve currencies and a trade surplus), but the American trade deficit with China, $375.2 billion last year, offers perhaps the best example of how a strong currency and trade deficits are connected. Still, there are enormous benefits to being able to print paper money and have the world treat it as if it were gold. Other countries need American dollars, and they are willing to pay a premium to hold them. Valery Giscard d‚ÄôEstaing, finance minister of France from 1962 to 1966, called this an ‚Äúexorbitant privilege.‚Äù Once they have amassed those all-important dollars, countries use them to buy United States Treasury bonds. (China alone held $1.2 trillion dollars of United States government debt at the end of 2017.) This enormous global demand for American debt means that the United States can borrow at relatively low interest rates, financing its budget deficits away. The ‚Äúexorbitant privilege‚Äù extends to ordinary Americans, who have access to a vast supply of credit and can borrow to buy homes and cars at lower interest rates. As the trade war rhetoric escalates, some raise the fear that China could sell off its dollar-denominated assets, which could trigger a rise in interest rates, inflation and possibly devaluation of the dollar. Even the threat of a sudden sell-off can stir up trouble in global currency markets. China could also diversify its cash reserves away from the dollar and acquire yen, euro or sterling instruments, or commodities such as gold. Indeed, China has already been accumulating gold, ranking as one of the world‚Äôs largest importers of it. China and the United States are too closely economically intertwined via the dollar to make that a credible fear. United States treasuries are still the world‚Äôs safe haven of choice. And selling off American debt would cause the yuan to appreciate, which would put China‚Äôs exports at a disadvantage. Still, China is clearly taking steps to ensure a larger role for its currency. In 2015, the yuan was designated by the International Monetary Fund as one of five elite currencies in the world, along with the dollar, the euro, the pound and the yen. China is putting in place a pilot program with Russia and Angola, in which it can buy oil with yuan instead of with dollars. As the biggest importer of crude oil in the world, China believes it has the purchasing power to push for settlement in yuan. Even Saudi Arabia, a stalwart American ally, is under increasing pressure to accept yuan for its oil trade. If the yuan does become a global reserve currency, China, too, could see its influence and economic power expand even further. This is a strategic priority for China, and it is willing to wait. Although it is impossible to predict whether or when the dollar will be dethroned, history offers some clues: The pound sterling reigned supreme before the dollar gradually dislodged it. While the president and his supporters raise doubts about open trade, the dollar‚Äôs supremacy is closely tied to it. There is nothing guaranteed about that status, or all the benefits that come with it. Lan Cao is a novelist and a professor of international economic law at Chapman University‚Äôs Dale E.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Opinion By Peter Fritsch and Glenn R. Simpson Mr. Fritsch and Mr. Simpson¬†are the founders of the research firm Fusion GPS. Put aside Russian collusion for a moment. Press pause on possible presidential obstruction of justice. Forget Stormy Daniels. The most significant recent development involving the president may be that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has subpoenaed Trump Organization business records as part of his inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election. Those documents ‚Äî and records recently seized by the F.B.I. from the president‚Äôs personal lawyer Michael Cohen ‚Äî might answer a question raised by the president‚Äôs critics: Have certain real estate investors used Trump-branded properties to launder the proceeds of criminal activity around the world? We pored over Donald Trump‚Äôs business records for well over a year, at least those records you can get without a badge or a subpoena. We also hired a former British intelligence official, Christopher Steele, to look into Mr. Trump‚Äôs possible ties to Russia. In that 2015-2016 investigation, sponsored first by a Republican client and then by Democrats, we found strong indications that companies affiliated with Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, might have been entangled in foreign corruption. A string of bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s may have left Mr. Trump‚Äôs companies largely unable to tap traditional sources of financing. That could have forced him to look elsewhere for financing and partners at a time when money was pouring out of the former Soviet Union. Indeed, from New York to Florida, Panama to Azerbaijan, we found that Trump projects have relied heavily on foreign cash ‚Äî including from wealthy individuals from Russia and elsewhere with questionable, and even criminal, backgrounds. We saw money traveling through offshore shell companies, entities often used to obscure ownership. Many news organizations have since dug deeply into the Trump Organization‚Äôs projects and come away with similar findings. This reporting has not uncovered conclusive evidence that the Trump Organization or its principals knowingly abetted criminal activity. And it‚Äôs not reasonable to expect the company to keep track of every condo buyer in a Trump-branded building. But Mr. Trump‚Äôs company routinely teamed up with individuals whose backgrounds should have raised red flags. Consider the Bayrock Group, a developer that once had lavish offices in Trump Tower. The firm worked with Mr. Trump in the mid-2000s to build the Trump SoHo in Lower Manhattan, among other troubled projects. One of its principals was a Russian √©migr√©, Felix Sater, linked to organized crime who served time for felony assault and who later pleaded guilty to racketeering involving a $40 million stock fraud scheme. Belgian authorities accused a Kazakh financier recruited by Bayrock of carrying out a $55 million money-laundering scheme (that case was settled without an admission of guilt). Civil suits filed in Los Angeles and New York allege that a former mayor of the largest city in Kazakhstan and several of his family members laundered millions in stolen public funds, investing some of it in real estate, including units in Trump SoHo. (The family has denied wrongdoing and says it is the victim of political persecution.) Then there is Sunny Isles Beach, where over 60 individuals with Russian passports or addresses bought nearly $100 million worth of units in Trump-branded condominium towers in a part of South Florida known as Little Moscow. Among them were Russian government officials who made million-dollar investments and a Ukrainian owner of two units who pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of stolen property in a money-laundering scheme involving a former Ukrainian prime minister. In 2006, the sale of condos in the first international hotel venture under the Trump brand, the former Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower in Panama, fell, in large part, to a Brazilian named Alexandre Ventura Nogueira. He worked with a Colombian who was later convicted of money laundering. Mr. Nogueira told NBC News last year that he sold about half of his Trump condos to Russians, including some connected to the Russian mafia, and that some of his clients had ‚Äúquestionable backgrounds.‚Äù Three years later, as Reuters has reported, Panamanian authorities arrested Mr. Nogueira on charges of fraud and forgery unrelated to the Trump project. After getting out on bail, he fled to Brazil, where he faces a separate money-laundering investigation. In 2014, he fled Brazil, too. The Trumps typically claim to be passive partners in projects like Trump Ocean Club and that they had minimal dealings with the likes of Mr. Nogueira. (The chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, has said that no one in the Trump family remembers meeting or speaking to Mr. Nogueira. But there are photos of Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka with Mr. Nogueira.) Yet Mr. Trump‚Äôs limited public disclosures reveal his company has earned millions from licensing fees, a percentage of property sales and management fees in foreign projects. And the Trump family was sometimes personally involved in everything from a project‚Äôs design to its d√©cor. That appears to have been the case with the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a high-end residence and hotel that has yet to open. In 2012, the Trumps signed a licensing agreement with the local developer, Anar Mammadov ‚Äî the son of the country‚Äôs billionaire transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov, who an American diplomat once described in cables published by WikiLeaks as ‚Äúnotoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.‚Äù The Trump Organization has said that it conducted an extensive due-diligence review of Anar Mammadov and that questions about the source of his wealth surfaced after they signed the deal. Presumably, Mr. Mueller will want to see evidence of that. In Vancouver, the Trump Organization partnered with the son of Tony Tiah Thee Kian, a Malaysian oligarch who was convicted of providing a false report to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. That project, which was guided by Ivanka Trump and is one of the few Trump-branded properties to open since Mr. Trump took office, is now the subject of an F.B.I. counterintelligence inquiry, according to CNN. Mr. Garten, the Trump chief legal officer, told CNN: ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs role was and is limited to licensing its brand and managing the hotel. Accordingly, the company would have had no involvement in the financing of the project or the sale of units.‚Äù It remains unclear whether Mr. Mueller will investigate these deals, or already is. But a comprehensive investigation could raise questions about the Trump Organization‚Äôs compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which ‚Äî according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice ‚Äî makes it a crime for a United States company to act with willful blindness toward the corrupt activities of a foreign business partner. The former Donald Trump insider Steve Bannon has hinted darkly about the Trump family‚Äôs exposure to money laundering. And Mr. Mueller has already secured the indictment of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump‚Äôs former campaign chairman, on charges of money laundering related to his work in Ukraine. Federal prosecutors are reported to be looking into Jared Kushner‚Äôs family firm over its use of a federal program that offered wealthy Chinese investors visas in return for investments. Kushner Companies has denied any wrongdoing. The Trump family‚Äôs business entanglements are of more than historical significance. Americans need to be sure that major foreign policy decisions are made in the national interest ‚Äî not because of foreign ties forged by the president‚Äôs business ventures.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman ‚ÄúTrade wars are good, and easy to win.‚Äù So declared Donald Trump a few weeks ago, after announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Actually, trade wars are rarely good, and not at all easy to win ‚Äî especially if you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing. And boy, do these people not know what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs odd, in a way. After all, trade is clearly an issue about which Trump is truly passionate. He tried to kill Obamacare, but to all appearances his main concern was tarnishing his predecessor‚Äôs legacy. He wanted a tax cut, but more to score a ‚Äúwin‚Äù than because he cared about what was in it. But reducing the trade deficit has been a long-term Trump obsession, so you might expect him to learn something about how world trade works, or at least surround himself with people who do understand the subject. But he hasn‚Äôt. And what he doesn‚Äôt know can and will hurt you. In the case of steel, here‚Äôs what happened: First came the splashy announcement of big tariffs, ostensibly in the name of national security ‚Äî infuriating U.S. allies, which are the main source of our steel imports. Then came what looks like a climb-down: The administration has exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others from those tariffs. Was this climb-down a reaction to threats of retaliation, or did the administration not at first realize that the tariffs would mainly hit our allies? Either way, Trump may have gotten the worst of both worlds: angering countries that should be our friends and establishing a reputation as an untrustworthy ally and trading partner, without even doing much for the industry he was supposedly trying to help. Now comes Trumptrade II, the China Syndrome. On Thursday the administration announced that it would levy tariffs on a number of Chinese goods, with the specifics to be detailed later. How will this one work out? Let‚Äôs be clear: When it comes to the global economic order, China is in fact a bad citizen. In particular, it plays fast and loose on intellectual property, in effect ripping off technologies and ideas developed elsewhere. It also subsidizes some industries, including steel, contributing to world excess capacity. But while his coterie mentions these issues, Trump seems fixated on the U.S. trade deficit with China, which he keeps saying is $500 billion. (It‚Äôs actually $375 billion, but who‚Äôs counting?) What‚Äôs wrong with this fixation? First of all, much of that big deficit is a statistical illusion. China is, as some put it, the Great Assembler: Many Chinese exports are actually put together from parts produced elsewhere, especially South Korea and Japan. The classic example is the iPhone, which is ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù but in which Chinese labor and capital account for only a few percent of the final price. That‚Äôs an extreme example, but part of a broader pattern: Much of the apparent U.S. trade deficit with China ‚Äî probably almost half ‚Äî is really a deficit with the countries that sell components to Chinese industry (and with which China runs deficits). This in turn has two implications: America has much less trade leverage over China than Trump imagines, and a trade war with ‚ÄúChina‚Äù will anger a wider group of countries, some of them close allies. More important, China‚Äôs overall trade surplus is not currently a major problem either for the United States or the world as a whole. I use the word ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù advisedly. There was a time, not that long ago, when the U.S. had high unemployment and China, by keeping its currency undervalued and running big trade surpluses, made that unemployment problem worse. And at the time I was calling for the U.S. to play hardball on the issue. But that was then. Chinese trade surpluses have come way down; meanwhile, the U.S. no longer has high unemployment. Trump may think that our trade deficit with China means that it‚Äôs winning and we‚Äôre losing, but it just ain‚Äôt so. Chinese trade ‚Äî as opposed to other forms of Chinese malpractice ‚Äî is the wrong issue to get worked up over in the world of 2018. And here‚Äôs the thing: By bumbling into a trade war, Trump undermines our ability to do anything about the real issues. If you want to pressure China into respecting intellectual property, you need to assemble a coalition of nations hurt by Chinese ripoffs ‚Äî that is, other advanced countries, like Japan, South Korea and European nations. Yet Trump is systematically alienating those countries, with things like his on-again-off-again steel tariff and his threat to put tariffs on goods that, while assembled in China, are mainly produced elsewhere. All in all, Trump‚Äôs trade policy is quickly turning into an object lesson in the wages of ignorance. By refusing to do its homework, the Trump team is managing to lose friends while failing to influence people. The truth is that trade wars are bad, and almost everyone ends up losing economically. If anyone ‚Äúwins,‚Äù it will be nations that gain geopolitical influence because America is squandering its own reputation. And that means that to the extent that anyone emerges as a victor from the Trump trade war, it will be ‚Ä¶ China. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Politics,"Advertisement By PETER BAKERAPRIL 15, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî The Trump administration plans to impose new sanctions against Russia on Monday to punish it for enabling the Syrian government‚Äôs use of chemical weapons in its civil war, the latest in a series of actions by both sides underscoring the deterioration in relations between Moscow and the West. The sanctions, coming shortly after American-led airstrikes against facilities linked to Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons, are meant to signal that the United States holds responsible not just the government of President Bashar al-Assad but also his patrons in Russia and Iran. President Trump has vowed that Syria‚Äôs allies will pay a ‚Äúbig price‚Äù for facilitating the suspected use of poison gas. But it remained unclear how far Mr. Trump would go in trying to shape events in Syria, which has been racked by civil war for seven years. President Emmanuel Macron of France, who along with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain joined in the strike on Syrian targets, said on Sunday night that he had persuaded Mr. Trump to keep a small American ground force in Syria despite the president‚Äôs public declaration that he wanted to get out. ‚ÄúWe convinced him it was necessary to stay,‚Äù Mr. Macron said in a televised interview with French journalists. ‚ÄúI assure you, we have convinced him that it is necessary to stay for the long term.‚Äù Advertisement American officials, however, disputed that, saying that Mr. Macron misinterpreted the conversation. About 2,000 American troops are in Syria to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, not to play a role in the civil war. In public comments before the chemical attack that prompted him to launch airstrikes, Mr. Trump said he wanted to pull them out right away. Advisers urged him to hold off, and he gave them five to six months to complete a withdrawal. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe U.S. mission has not changed ‚Äî the president has been clear that he wants U.S. forces to come home as quickly as possible,‚Äù Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement Sunday night. ‚ÄúWe are determined to completely crush ISIS and create the conditions that will prevent its return. In addition, we expect our regional allies and partners to take greater responsibility both militarily and financially for securing the region.‚Äù The new American sanctions were announced on Sunday by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and the administration‚Äôs leading public voice excoriating Russia in recent days. ‚ÄúThey will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use,‚Äù she said on ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù on CBS. ‚ÄúAnd so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it.‚Äù Mr. Trump has tried through most of his presidency to forge a friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and has largely avoided criticizing him personally even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigated whether Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, his administration has taken increasing action against Russia, and the president singled out Mr. Putin over Syria‚Äôs use of chemical weapons on Twitter and again in a televised speech on Friday night. New sanctions on Monday would be the third round enacted by the Trump administration against Russia in the past four weeks. Last month, the administration targeted Russian companies and individuals for intervening in the 2016 election and mounting cyberattacks against Western facilities. It followed that this month with penalties against Mr. Putin‚Äôs inner circle, singling out some of Russia‚Äôs richest men and top government officials. The administration also expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain. Russia responded by expelling 60 American diplomats and closing the American Consulate in St. Petersburg. Mr. Putin spoke with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Sunday to discuss the confrontation in Syria and reaffirm his opposition to the airstrike by American, British and French forces. ‚ÄúVladimir Putin, in particular, stressed that if such actions, carried out in violation of the U.N. Charter, continue, it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,‚Äù the Kremlin said in a statement. America‚Äôs allies in Britain and France declared that they were prepared to act again if necessary, but made clear that they did not want to become further involved in Syria. ‚ÄúThe rest of the Syrian war must proceed as it will,‚Äù Boris Johnson, Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary, said on the BBC, adding that the ‚Äúprimary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons.‚Äù Advertisement International inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were in Syria on Sunday to start an investigation of the suspected chemical attack that killed dozens of people in the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7 and prompted the American-led retaliatory strike. American officials have said video and other evidence points to the use of both chlorine and sarin gas by the Syrian government. Russia has asserted that the attack was fabricated to justify military action by the West. The strikes against Syria were designed to avoid provoking Russia into a response. By hitting just three targets and limiting the attack to a single night, the Trump administration seemed to avoid compelling Moscow to lash back.

But Ms. Haley said the administration was determined to make Moscow pay a price for supporting Mr. Assad, noting that it had vetoed six United Nations resolutions related to Syria and chemical weapons. ‚ÄúAssad knew that Russia had its back,‚Äù she said on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday.‚Äù ‚ÄúAssad knew that Russia would cover for him at the United Nations, and Assad got reckless and he used it in a way that was far more aggressive.‚Äù The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. The Treasury Department, which Ms. Haley said would issue the sanctions, declined to elaborate. Mr. Trump sought on Sunday to defend his use of ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù to characterize the Syria strike, a phrase that evoked memories of President George W. Bush‚Äôs visit to an aircraft carrier during the Iraq war that became a symbol of premature victory. ‚ÄúThe Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‚ÄòMission Accomplished,‚Äô‚Äù Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúI knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!‚Äù Advisers said Mr. Trump meant only that the specific mission of hitting three targets in Syria had been carried out, not that the larger goal of thwarting Mr. Assad‚Äôs use of chemical weapons had been met. American officials have acknowledged that the strikes did not eliminate Syria‚Äôs chemical weapons capability but expressed confidence that they diminished them and hoped that they would deter Mr. Assad from using them again. The phrase ‚Äúmission accomplished‚Äù has been freighted since 2003 when Mr. Bush visited the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln after the fall of Saddam Hussein and declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq while appearing before a giant banner emblazoned with the words. Mr. Bush himself never used the phrase, and White House aides later said it was meant to congratulate the carrier crew as it returned home from a long mission, but it became a damaging symbol for Mr. Bush as the war raged on for years. Advertisement Critics said Mr. Trump was going too far in claiming success. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to say at this point that the mission has been accomplished,‚Äù Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said on ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù on CNN. The operation was accomplished ‚Äúwith the precision that our military is capable of,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúbut saying that it has been a success, we won‚Äôt know until we see whether the regime continues to use chemical weapons.‚Äù Other lawmakers focused on Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision to use force without consulting Congress, an issue that has flared under presidents of both parties for decades. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is not a king,‚Äù Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said on ‚ÄúFace the Nation.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a president. He‚Äôs supposed to come to Congress to seek permission to initiate a war. As Ambassador Haley said, they‚Äôve been following these chemical weapons attacks for months. They clearly had time to come to Congress to seek our permission.‚Äù Still, supporters of Mr. Trump and even some longtime detractors praised him for taking action against the use of chemical weapons without escalating so much that it might draw the United States deeper into Syria‚Äôs civil war or provoke a dangerous retaliation. ‚ÄúI think this administration‚Äôs actions against Syria were appropriate,‚Äù John O. Brennan, who was C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, said on ‚ÄúMeet the Press‚Äù on NBC. ‚ÄúAnd I tend to be a critic of this administration.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Donald J. Boudreaux The many Americans now cheering President Trump‚Äôs willingness to fight a trade war with China no doubt believe that trade in recent years with that Asian nation has destroyed too many American jobs. Not long ago an academic paper by the economists David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson garnered an unusual amount of public attention because of its estimate that trade with China from 1999 to 2011 destroyed 2.4 million jobs in the United States. Our anxiety about trade-related job loss is not confined to China. Just a few weeks ago Mr. Trump declared that the North American Free Trade Agreement caused a ‚Äúmassive relocation of companies and jobs.‚Äù On Nafta‚Äôs 20th anniversary, in 2014, the trade skeptic Lori Wallach complained that the agreement had destroyed one million American jobs. These estimates of jobs destroyed by trade sound big, but they‚Äôre actually tiny. Relative to overall routine job destruction and creation ‚Äî ‚Äújob churn‚Äù ‚Äî the number of American jobs destroyed by trade is minuscule. In January alone, the number of American workers who were laid off or dismissed from their jobs was 1.8 million. The number of workers who quit their jobs that month was 3.3 million. Adding in workers who left their jobs for other reasons, such as retirement and disability, the number of job separations in January was 5.4 million. But there were 5.6 million hires in January, too. Those numbers are typical of most months. Awareness of job churn should calm Americans‚Äô fears about imports. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data on monthly nonfarm discharges and layoffs since September 2006. Unsurprisingly, this number peaked during the Great Recession, at 2.57 million in January 2009. But even excluding the recession months, the monthly average number of workers in the United States who lose their jobs is around 1.75 million. In a normal year, then, the number of workers laid off or dismissed averages 21 million. Compared with the number of total annual job losses, therefore, job losses from trade shrink into insignificance. Ms. Wallach‚Äôs estimate that Nafta destroyed one million jobs in its first 20 years means that it took freer trade with Mexico two decades to destroy as many American jobs as are now destroyed every 18 days on average. Mr. Autor, Mr. Dorn and Mr. Hanson‚Äôs calculation that 2.4 million American jobs were ended by trade with China from 1999 through 2011 implies that the 13-year ‚ÄúChina shock,‚Äù as the paper called it, eliminated as many jobs as are eliminated, on average, every 41 days. Clearly, trade is a trifling source of job loss when compared with other sources. These other sources are ordinary economic changes that, like trade, fuel our high standard of living. Every time our tastes as consumers change, we alter the way we spend our money. The number of jobs producing things that we lose our taste for, such as cigarettes, decreases, while the number of jobs producing things that we now have a greater fancy for, such as exercise gear, increases. Perhaps the major source of job destruction and creation is technological innovation. In the early 1900s automobiles famously destroyed jobs for buggy-whip makers and blacksmiths. Starting in the 1980s, personal computers and email killed jobs for stenographers and document deliverers. Today, A.T.M.s and online banking apps are eliminating jobs for bank tellers. Yet despite these and innumerable other innovations that caused the demise of particular jobs, the number of jobs in the United States economy is today higher than ever ‚Äî and contrary to popular myth, the earnings of ordinary Americans recently hit an all-time high. The reason is that job destruction in a market economy is also job creation. When consumers buy less of a particular product, they spend or invest more money elsewhere, thus creating not only new and better products but also new jobs. Consumers‚Äô freedom to change how they spend their money prompts entrepreneurs and investors to produce things that consumers value most highly, and to do so as efficiently as possible. The result is economic growth. Fears of losing jobs to trade are inconsistent with our larger embrace of innovation and competition. More ominously, given that trade-induced job losses are a tiny portion of all job losses, such fears are wildly overblown ‚Äî so much so that they now have America and the world on the brink of a potentially calamitous trade war. And all for naught. President Trump‚Äôs protectionism will simply not create the multitude of jobs that its champions predict. Far worse, however, is the fact that the longer we tolerate this hostility to one particular source of economic change and growth, the more likely we are to grow hostile to technological innovation and other more significant sources of economic change and growth. And it would then become impossible to make America great again. Donald J. Boudreaux is a professor of economics and a senior fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters JAKARTA ‚Äî Indonesia, like other emerging markets, has historically struggled to keep accurate records due to a lack of expertise and resources, but the public and private sectors are now looking at blockchain technology to overcome some of these challenges.  Blockchain, the digital data structure best known for underpinning cryptocurrencies, provides a shared record of information maintained and updated by a network of computers rather than a centralized authority. This approach to data management could help Southeast Asia's largest economy, which has difficulties keeping accurate data and control over everything from food output to personal information for its 250 million people across 17,000 islands.  The tax system is one such area and tech firm Online Pajak has launched a blockchain-driven app that allows customers to share encrypted tax data with institutions such as the tax and treasury offices, banks and the central bank. As well as increasing transparency and reducing paperwork and errors, it would mean tax payers can know for sure they have paid their dues, said Online Pajak founder Charles Guinot. ""Today in Indonesia, there's no proof you've paid,"" Guinot said at a briefing to launch the product last week. The blockchain verification process could also help address doubts that hang over elections in countries like Indonesia. Horizon State, an Australian firm, plans to launch a phone app on Sumatra island in July, which would enable direct polling on various local policy issues. Nimo Naamani, the firm's co-founder, said the system uses blockchain verification and could reduce voting fraud and address the electoral challenges faced by countries with large populations dispersed across remote towns and islands with poor access. Indonesian banks are also looking at the technology: a survey by Bain & Company published last year found about 80 percent of executives at Ô¨Ånancial institutions think blockchain will signiÔ¨Åcantly impact markets. A similar percentage expects to start using it before 2020. Rico Usthavia Frans, director of digital banking and technology at Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's second-biggest bank by assets, said it was looking at applying blockchain for trade financing, but lenders were waiting for guidelines from regulators. The Financial Services Authority has a dedicated team to study how blockchain could help the industry, said Fithri Hadi, the regulator's director of finance innovation. Crucially, policymakers see the potential to reduce graft in Indonesia's public programes. Farm subsidies, for example, are allocated in the state budget based on the previous year‚Äôs harvest, though such harvest production statements are difficult to verify due to the large numbers of small farmers. This increases the risk of such estimates being overstated in order to receive more funds. The government is looking at how it can use the technology directly to authenticate information from fund recipients. ""We want to use the technology platform to be able to identify those groups of people who need to get the benefit,"" Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawat told Reuters, noting her staff are looking at ways to use blockchain for tasks such as subsidy disbursement to micro-loan programes. Blockchain has gained traction in other emerging markets, such as Estonia, which has employed it for a number of services since 2012. Applications include national health, judicial, legislation, security and commercial code systems. However, Iwan Djuniardi, the tax office's director of transformational technology, cautions the pace of adoption in Indonesia could be slower. ""It takes time to process a management change before we adopt a new technology. Even cloud technology is still being debated, let alone blockchain,"" Djuniardi said.

Now Paddle8 is trying a new tack: merging with The Native, a Swiss technology and e-commerce company, and adopting the use of blockchain, the technology that underpins virtual currencies like Bitcoin. Paddle8 announced on Tuesday that it had taken an investment from The Native, creating what the two say is a partnership meant to adapt online art sales ‚Äî and potentially more ‚Äî to an age of wealthy millennials well versed in virtual currencies. Their first partnership will be Paddle8 Lab, which is meant to help introduce tech to online art and luxury sales and will draw on The Native‚Äôs Blockchain Lab division.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by If cryptocurrency and blockchain technology really are the future of money, the world‚Äôs central banks need to get involved, a former Fed governor argues. By Neil Irwin Many enthusiasts of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are motivated by deep skepticism of the central banks that control the world‚Äôs money supply. But what if central banks themselves entered the game? What would happen if the Federal Reserve, or the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan used blockchain technology to create their own virtual currencies? Besides, that is, having some cryptocurrency fans‚Äô heads explode? A former Fed governor ‚Äî who was also a finalist to lead the central bank ‚Äî thinks the idea deserves serious consideration. ‚ÄúMost central banks have a view that these crypto-assets are clever, like guys in the garage did it and it‚Äôs kind of cool, or risky,‚Äù given the potential investor losses and widespread fraud, said Kevin Warsh, who was a governor at the Fed from 2006 to 2011 and was a top contender to become its chairman late last year when President Trump instead appointed Jerome Powell. If he had returned to the Fed, Mr. Warsh said, he would have appointed a team ‚Äúto think about the Fed creating FedCoin, where we would bring legal activities into a digital coin.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot that it would supplant and replace cash,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut it would be a pretty effective way when the next crisis happens for us to maybe conduct monetary policy.‚Äù He added that blockchain technology, which allows reliable, decentralized record keeping of transactions, could be useful in the payment systems operated by the Fed, which enable the transfer of trillions of dollars between banks. ‚ÄúIt strikes me that a central bank digital currency might have a role to play there,‚Äù Mr. Warsh, who is now a distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, told several reporters Thursday evening. Some central banks are already doing work in this vein, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England. And Mr. Powell acknowledged the potential applications in his confirmation hearing for the Fed chairmanship in November, saying, ‚ÄúWe actually look at blockchain as something that may have significant applications in the wholesale payments part of the economy.‚Äù It would be quite a twist if a technology whose most ardent fans are motivated by distrust of central banks became a key tool for those banks.  But it would address some of the concerns connected to Bitcoin and its many privately created rivals. To the degree that the value of existing cryptocurrencies fluctuates wildly, they are ill-suited as a medium of exchange. Central banks have spent hundreds of years learning how to keep the value of money stable. And to the degree Bitcoin and the like facilitate tax evasion, money laundering and fraud, they will be a target of global law enforcement. Central banks are used to building systems that allow enforcement of those laws. It‚Äôs clear that central banks weighing use of blockchain technology don‚Äôt share the more anarchist impulses of some of the most die-hard cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But there may be more commonality than it might seem. As Mr. Warsh argues, if people really do believe that digital currencies in some form are the future of money, it would behoove central banks to treat them as more than a novelty. ‚ÄúCongress gave the Fed a monopoly over money,‚Äù Mr. Warsh said. ‚ÄúAnd if the next generation of cryptocurrencies look more like money and less like gold ‚Äî and have less volatility associated with them so they would be not just a speculative asset but could be a reliable unit of account ‚Äî as a purely defensive matter I wouldn‚Äôt want somebody to take that monopoly from me.‚Äù In other words, if cryptocurrency enthusiasts are correct that this technology could become a better way of carrying out even routine transactions, the Fed and its counterparts are the institutions that have the most to lose.

The joint initiative dubbed TrustChain aims to make it easier for consumers to track diamonds and precious metals through the various steps of the supply chain as they become finished pieces jewelry, the companies said. The technology will initially help track six styles of diamond and gold engagement rings and is expected to be available to consumers by the end of 2018, the companies said.

Advertisement Because it makes it easier for multiple parties to jointly create and update tamper-proof records, the firms involved in the project believe it is well suited to securely and efficiently track and prove the origin and ethical sourcing of jewelry. Richline Group had previously attempted to create a similar database using different technology, but the process was still heavily manual and prone to inaccuracies, Mark Hanna, the company's chief marketing officer, said in an interview.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Peter S. Goodman LONDON ‚Äî In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by na√Øve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair. The primary villain in this narrative is China, the country that Mr. Trump has placed at the center of the combative trade policy he is advancing. Steep tariffs on steel and aluminum set to take effect this week are portrayed as targeting China, even as they mostly hit other powers. In a broadening of the battle to electronics and clothing, the Trump administration is readying at least $50 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on imported Chinese goods. If these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump‚Äôs policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be far more effective if they go together,‚Äù said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. ‚ÄúThe fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.‚Äù China‚Äôs staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors. In many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing‚Äôs wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations. These problems are real and persistent. None are easily solved, despite the political appeal of vows to get tough with China. China is an inextricable part of the global supply chain, producing the piece parts of cars, gadgets, bluejeans and practically anything else made by human hands. Its products ‚Äî and, increasingly, its investment ‚Äî are crucial components in every economy. Given this, no single country has the power to force China to reform its ways, the thinking goes. China can get around tariffs in one nation by sending its wares elsewhere. It can buy its way into markets by wielding its largess, building infrastructure and proffering loans. Most experts assume that the only way to make progress in pressuring China to play fair is through collective action. Major economies must join forces, taking cases at the World Trade Organization and harmonizing their policies. ‚ÄúThere are some grave concerns on China, who are massively subsidizing state-owned companies,‚Äù the European Union trade minister, Cecilia Malmstrom, said in January, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ‚ÄúAnd there, yes, we could work with the U.S.‚Äù Yet Mr. Trump is pursuing the opposite course. In one of his first acts as president, he renounced American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade bloc forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China‚Äôs rise. The pact included prohibitions on state subsidies, in what was supposed to be a template that could eventually influence China‚Äôs commercial realities. Mr. Trump has also attacked the World Trade Organization ‚Äî the linchpin of the global trading system and the ultimate venue for collective action ‚Äî even suggesting that he might revoke American participation. In a formal statement to a congressional committee on Wednesday, a top White House trade official called the W.T.O. ‚Äúwholly inadequate to deal with China‚Äôs version of a state-dominated economy that rejects market principles.‚Äù Mr. Trump has, at least for now, exempted Canada and Mexico from the bite of his tariffs on steel and aluminum. But that is conditional on their satisfying his demands for sweetened terms in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Others ‚Äî Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and South Korea ‚Äî have won a temporary reprieve. But they did so only after intense lobbying. Stalwart allies were reduced to effectively begging to be spared from an American offensive. It does not make for fertile conditions for coalition building. ‚ÄúIt takes everybody‚Äôs eye off the real issue,‚Äù said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ‚ÄúNow, no one is talking about China‚Äôs overcapacity on steel. When you‚Äôre hitting the Europeans and the Japanese and the South Koreans on steel, how easy is it going to be for those countries to cooperate with you on forced technology transfers?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou would need all of these countries to agree on these issues, which requires a tremendous amount of cooperation and trust,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs such a dearth of that now.‚Äù Most fundamentally, Mr. Trump‚Äôs decision to cite a supposed threat to American national security as justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs has prompted allies to question the reliability of their friendship with the United States. China produces only about 2 percent of the steel used in the United States, while Canada is the largest supplier. The national security justification for tariffs rests on the idea that metal is a building block of defense, and that America‚Äôs access is so imperiled that it must protect domestic suppliers. Given that the United States already produces some two-thirds of the steel it uses, most economists dismiss that argument as absurd. In advancing it, they say, Mr. Trump risks dealing a real national security blow to the United States by threatening the durability of its alliances. Japan and Germany ‚Äî two major steel producers ‚Äî are home to American military bases. The vast majority of the European Union‚Äôs members belong to NATO. South Korea, another major source of steel, is key to the talks that Mr. Trump has said he intends to hold with North Korea to resolve the nuclear crisis. ‚ÄúIt strikes me as not helpful to put these tariffs on metals against some of our most important military allies,‚Äù said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. ‚ÄúTrump is saying, ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt rely on you to provide high-grade steel in the event of a war.‚Äô That is a very bizarre thing to say to an ally when you have military facilities in their countries. People there might wonder: What does the average American think of my country if their president is saying we can‚Äôt rely upon them?‚Äù   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and MAGGIE HABERMANAPRIL 9, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî The special counsel is investigating a payment made to President Trump‚Äôs foundation by a Ukrainian steel magnate for a talk during the campaign, according to three people briefed on the matter, as part of a broader examination of streams of foreign money to Mr. Trump and his associates in the years leading up to the election. Investigators subpoenaed the Trump Organization this year for an array of records about business with foreign nationals. In response, the company handed over documents about a $150,000 donation that the Ukrainian billionaire, Victor Pinchuk, made in September 2015 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute appearance by Mr. Trump that month through a video link to a conference in Kiev. Michael D. Cohen, the president‚Äôs personal lawyer whose office and hotel room were raided on Monday in an apparently unrelated case, solicited the donation. The contribution from Mr. Pinchuk, who has sought closer ties for Ukraine to the West, was the largest the foundation received in 2015 from anyone besides Mr. Trump himself. The subpoena is among signs in recent months that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is interested in interactions that Mr. Trump or his associates had with countries beyond Russia, though it is not clear what other payments he is scrutinizing. Advertisement Mr. Mueller also ordered the Trump Organization to turn over documents, emails and other communications about several Russians, including some whose names have not been publicly tied to Mr. Trump, according to the three people, who would not be named discussing the ongoing investigation. The identities of the Russians were unclear. Advertisement The payment from Mr. Pinchuk ‚Äúis curious because it comes during a campaign and is from a foreigner and looks like an effort to buy influence,‚Äù said Marcus S. Owens, a former head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. He called the donation ‚Äúan unusual amount of money for such a short speech.‚Äù Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, did not return several messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer for the Trump Organization. When The New York Times revealed the existence of the subpoena in March, Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates played it down as a routine court order to ensure the Trump Organization had handed over all the documents Mr. Mueller had demanded. Mr. Trump assailed the special counsel investigation on Monday as a ‚Äúwitch hunt,‚Äù reaching for a favored insult in response to the seizure of Mr. Cohen‚Äôs records. He complained that he had cooperated with the inquiry and viewed the warrant for the raid, obtained by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after a referral from Mr. Mueller, as an extreme step. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a disgraceful situation,‚Äù he told reporters at the White House. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a total witch hunt. I‚Äôve been saying it for a long time. I‚Äôve wanted to keep it down. I‚Äôve given over a million pages in documents to the special counsel.‚Äù What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Mueller has also examined a deal Mr. Cohen was putting together with Mr. Trump to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mr. Trump said last summer that Mr. Mueller should not look at his or his family‚Äôs finances beyond issues related directly to Russia. But the special counsel‚Äôs investigators have questioned witnesses about whether money from the Persian Gulf had been used to finance Mr. Trump‚Äôs political efforts and asked for information on Mr. Pinchuk. The inquiry into the Trump Organization‚Äôs payments from foreign nationals underscores how diffuse Mr. Trump‚Äôs sources of income have been over many years. And the destination of Mr. Pinchuk‚Äôs donation ‚Äî the Trump Foundation instead of the president‚Äôs personal coffers ‚Äî raised fresh questions about how the president handled the entity he set up to deal with charitable giving. Advertisement Mr. Trump‚Äôs foundation attracted scrutiny during the 2016 campaign over revelations about his lack of financial support for it and his use of it to pay legal settlements rather than fulfill pledges he made to give to charity. In 2007, Mr. Trump used $20,000 from the foundation to buy a six-foot-tall portrait of himself. Two weeks after he was elected president, the foundation acknowledged in a tax form that it might have broken federal rules designed to prohibit self-dealing, when charities use their money to benefit principals in their organization. In the same filing, the foundation disclosed the donation from Mr. Pinchuk for Mr. Trump‚Äôs video appearance. Mr. Pinchuk is the son-in-law of a former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, who from 1994 to 2005 led a government criticized for corruption, nepotism and the murder of dissident journalists. Mr. Pinchuk, who has been accused by steel makers in the United States of illegally dumping steel on the American market at artificially low prices, drew more scrutiny during the campaign for his ties to Hillary Clinton and her family foundation. He has donated more than $13 million to that organization since 2006. Mr. Trump‚Äôs appearance was broadcast at the Yalta European Strategy conference, which promotes pro-European Union policies for Ukraine. Through his own foundation, Mr. Pinchuk sponsors the affair, which typically attracts well-known former Western leaders like former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and former President Bill Clinton. It was moved to Kiev after Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea in 2014. In a statement, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation said it reached out to Mr. Trump and other world leaders to help ‚Äúpromote strengthened and enduring ties between Ukraine and the West.‚Äù The foundation said the donation was ‚Äúa specific request of Mr. Trump Foundation in September of 2015 when there were multiple candidates for the Republican nomination for president and it was by no means assured that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016.‚Äù At the time, Mr. Trump occupied an unusual position in the presidential race. Though he was the Republican front-runner, the primary field was crowded and he was being vetted or seriously considered by few, if any, in the news media or the Republican establishment. Advertisement The event, his first foray into global politics during the campaign, was set up by Doug Schoen, a veteran political consultant and pollster who works with Mr. Pinchuk, according to a person familiar with how the speech was arranged. Mr. Schoen, a frequent Fox News guest, has known Mr. Trump for years and contacted him personally to set it up at the end of August 2015, according to the person. Mr. Trump did not raise the prospect of any payment. But the next day, Mr. Cohen called Mr. Schoen to solicit the $150,000 as an honorarium, the person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Schoen, who had gotten to know Mr. Cohen by running into him in the green room at Fox News, dealt with him and not Mr. Trump directly, according to another person briefed on the exchange. The Kiev talk received little attention, with the scant coverage focused on the awkward nature of Mr. Trump‚Äôs delivery. He repeatedly stopped speaking, apparently believing he had to pause to give translators time to relay what he was saying. ‚ÄúYou need not wait for any translation,‚Äù Mr. Schoen finally told him. Mr. Trump continued to pause and said he was having trouble hearing. ‚ÄúThe sound system is terrible because there is a huge delay and feedback,‚Äù he said. Mr. Trump used the appearance to criticize President Barack Obama amid deteriorating relations between the United States and Russia over its incursions into Ukraine, which had begun a year earlier. ‚ÄúOur president is not strong and he is not doing what he should be doing for the Ukraine,‚Äù Mr. Trump said, using the article before Ukraine, which is seen as insulting by some Ukrainians. ‚ÄúPutin does not respect our president whatsoever,‚Äù he said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Ukraine, once a part of the Soviet Union, has been at the center of another part of Mr. Mueller‚Äôs inquiry. He is investigating the consulting work done in Kiev by Mr. Trump‚Äôs former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, for the country‚Äôs pro-Russian former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of tax fraud and other financial crimes. He resigned from Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign in August 2016 after handwritten ledgers were made public showing that he received $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments from Mr. Yanukovych‚Äôs pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Jack Ewing and Ana Swanson BERLIN ‚Äî A few weeks ago, it felt as if a trade war pitting the United States against allies like Australia, Canada and the European Union was over before it even began. The Trump administration dispensed so many temporary exemptions to steel and aluminum tariffs that many countries figured the threats were just political theater. But with only days left before the exemptions expire and punitive tariffs take effect, it‚Äôs dawning on foreign leaders that decades of warm relations with the United States carry little weight with a president dismissive of diplomatic norms and hostile toward the ground rules of international trade. What began as a way to protect American steel and aluminum jobs has since become a cudgel that the Trump administration is using to extract concessions in other areas, including car exports to Europe or negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. As a May 1 deadline looms, the decision on whether to grant permanent exemptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs, and to whom, appears likely to come down to the whims of President Trump, who has seesawed between scrapping and rejoining global trade deals. The European Union, the United States‚Äô biggest trading partner, indicated over the weekend that it was losing hope of reaching an agreement in the face of what many of the region‚Äôs political leaders regard as unreasonable demands. While a last-minute extension of the deadline is still possible, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who each met with President Trump in Washington last week, spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain over the weekend about enacting retaliatory tariffs if the European Union did not receive an exemption. The German government said in a statement that Ms. Merkel, Mr. Macron and Ms. May agreed that if the tariffs go into force, ‚ÄúThe European Union should be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules.‚Äù The uncertainty is sowing chaos in international supply networks. Car companies and other manufacturers do not know whether ships carrying steel may suddenly be barred from American ports. Some countries are confident they will avoid the tariffs. Australia is treating an exemption as if it‚Äôs a done deal. Brazil, which primarily exports slab steel to American manufacturers, is hoping to escape by agreeing on limited quotas for more sophisticated products. Argentina is counting on the good relationship between its president, Mauricio Macri, and Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúIn the conversations that we have on the issue, the positive relationships between our governments ‚Äî and our presidents ‚Äî certainly comes up,‚Äù Miguel Braun, Argentina‚Äôs trade secretary, said in an interview. But it‚Äôs unclear whether the confidence is justified. The White House has not confirmed that Australia, Brazil or Argentina will receive exemptions. In terms of the potential disruption to the global economy, the dispute with Europe may be the most critical. The United States and the European Union account for about one-third of world trade. Only a few years ago the United States and Europe were discussing the possibility of eliminating almost all trans-Atlantic trade barriers. Now they are stymied by fundamentally different worldviews. As the Europeans see it, Mr. Trump is demanding concessions that would make them accomplices in dismantling a postwar trade framework they hold sacred. The Europeans want to play by the rules of the World Trade Organization; the Americans are making demands that would force the Europeans to break them. ‚ÄúIf we stick to the rules,‚Äù said Thiess Petersen, an analyst at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany, ‚Äúthere is no chance for concessions.‚Äù German cars, a particular target of presidential ire, are one of the major sticking points. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been handling talks with the European Union, has been pushing the 28-nation bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported American cars as one way of cutting its trade surplus with the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser, said that the United States wanted more concessions before it granted a permanent exclusion. But if the European Union accepted the demand for lower car tariffs, international treaties would require it to apply similar terms to automobiles from all other members of the World Trade Organization. The biggest beneficiary might be China. A member of the W.T.O., China is keen to become an auto exporter and would be thrilled to get easier access to Europe without giving up anything in return. The Europeans are offended that they are being asked to negotiate in the first place. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, said last week that the union would discuss terms of trade with the United States only after it had received a permanent and unconditional exemption to the steel and aluminum tariffs. ‚ÄúWhen that is confirmed by the president,‚Äù Ms. Malmstrom told reporters in Strasbourg, France, ‚Äúwe are willing as always to discuss anything. But we are not negotiating anything under threat.‚Äù In an extension of the disconnect between the two NATO allies, the president has expressed annoyance that he can‚Äôt just bypass the European Union apparatus altogether and work out deals with favored leaders like Mr. Macron. That approach would be illegal under the E.U. treaty and undermine one of the bloc‚Äôs fundamental principles ‚Äî that all the members act in unison on trade matters. ‚ÄúI would rather deal just with France,‚Äù Mr. Trump said at the White House on April 24, ahead of a visit by Mr. Macron. ‚ÄúThe Union is very tough for us. They have trade barriers that are unacceptable.‚Äù David O‚ÄôSullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that if tariffs go into effect, ‚Äúwe are back to the need to pursue this with the World Trade Organization, including the possibility of imposing rebalancing counter-tariffs on equivalent U.S. exports.‚Äù The E.U. has already drawn up a list of products targeted for retaliation. They are meant to inflict maximum pain on the Republican heartland, including recreational power boats made in Tennessee, digital flight recorders made in Arizona and playing cards made in Kentucky. But the strategy may not be effective. Business leaders who have visited Washington recently said that the president had been unmoved by protests from members of his own party. Together, the countries seeking to extend temporary exemptions account for about half of American steel imports. The United States has already granted South Korea a permanent exemption as part of  a revised trade deal. Other countries have already been denied exemptions and started paying tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. They include China and Russia as well as Japan, a close ally. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan refused to be coerced into one-on-one negotiations, instead trying to coax the United States back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Mr. Trump left last year. ‚ÄúOur country‚Äôs position is that T.P.P is best for both of the countries, and based on that position we will be approaching the talks,‚Äù Mr. Abe said in mid-April. Mr. Trump was not persuaded. After briefly considering rejoining the trade agreement, he reversed course, writing on Twitter that the deal had ‚Äútoo many contingencies.‚Äù For Canada and Mexico, among the largest exporters of steel and aluminum to the United States, the Trump administration has tied their exemptions to Nafta talks. Negotiators from the three countries are scheduled to meet again on May 7 as they push to work through the major remaining disagreements and announce a revised pact. The direct impact of the tariffs on world trade, assuming they take effect, will be minimal, economists say. Though steel plays a big role in the public imagination, it accounts for a sliver of global commerce. Economists are more worried that a trade war will escalate. Many of the effects will be difficult to predict. ‚ÄúWhen two elephants fight,‚Äù said Miguel Ponce, head of Argentina‚Äôs Center for the Study of Foreign Trade in the 21st Century, ‚Äúit is the grass that suffers the most.‚Äù Jack Ewing reported from Berlin, and Ana Swanson from Washington.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by The questions show the special counsel‚Äôs focus on obstruction of justice and touch on some surprising other areas. By Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, recently provided President Trump‚Äôs lawyers a list of questions he wants answered in an interview. The New York Times obtained the list; here are the questions, along with the context and significance of each. The questions fall into categories based on four broad subjects. They are not quoted verbatim, and some were condensed. [Read our main story on the questions for Mr. Trump here.] What did you know about phone calls that Mr. Flynn made with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, in late December 2016? These questions revolve around whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice to protect Mr. Flynn from prosecution. His phone calls with Mr. Kislyak are at the heart of that inquiry. During the calls, Mr. Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to sanctions just announced by the Obama administration. But Mr. Trump‚Äôs aides publicly denied that sanctions were discussed and, when questioned by the F.B.I., Mr. Flynn denied it, as well. Mr. Mueller wants to know whether Mr. Flynn was operating on Mr. Trump‚Äôs behalf. Prosecutors may already know the answer: Mr. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying and is cooperating with investigators. What was your reaction to news reports on Jan. 12, 2017, and Feb. 8-9, 2017? In January, the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius revealed Mr. Flynn‚Äôs phone calls with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Ignatius questioned whether those conversations had violated a law prohibiting private citizens from attempting to undermine American policies. In February, The Washington Post revealed the true nature of Mr. Flynn‚Äôs conversations with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Mueller wants to know, among other things, whether Mr. Trump feared that his national security adviser had broken the law and then tried to shield him from consequences. What did you know about Sally Yates‚Äôs meetings about Mr. Flynn? Ms. Yates, the acting attorney general for the first weeks of the Trump administration, twice warned the White House that Mr. Flynn was lying, and those lies made him vulnerable to Russian blackmail. No one from the White House has ever said how much Mr. Trump knew about those warnings. How was the decision made to fire Mr. Flynn on Feb. 13, 2017? Eighteen days after Ms. Yates‚Äôs warning, Mr. Flynn was asked to resign. The White House said that Mr. Trump lost confidence in Mr. Flynn because he had lied. But the White House has never fully explained why, after learning about the lie, officials waited so long to act. After the resignations, what efforts were made to reach out to Mr. Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon? The Times recently revealed that, when Mr. Flynn began considering cooperating with the F.B.I., Mr. Trump‚Äôs lawyers floated the idea of a pardon. Mr. Mueller wants to know why. What was your opinion of Mr. Comey during the transition? The questions about Mr. Comey relate to whether Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last year to shield Mr. Flynn, or anyone else, from prosecution. Mr. Trump has denied that, saying he fired Mr. Comey because of his mishandling of the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server.  This question is important because, if Mr. Trump truly was upset about the Clinton investigation, he would have shown an early distaste for Mr. Comey. What did you think about Mr. Comey‚Äôs intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, 2017, about Russian election interference? The briefing revealed that American intelligence agencies had concluded that Russian operatives meddled in the election to hurt Mrs. Clinton and to boost Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on these conclusions and said he believes the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who denies any interference. What was your reaction to Mr. Comey‚Äôs briefing that day about other intelligence matters? This question addresses documents written by a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who said that Russia had gathered compromising information on Mr. Trump. The documents, which became known as the Steele Dossier, also claim that the Trump campaign had ties to the Russian government. Mr. Comey privately briefed Mr. Trump about these documents. What was the purpose of your Jan. 27, 2017, dinner with Mr. Comey, and what was said? A few weeks after his briefing, Mr. Comey was called to the White House for a private dinner. Mr. Comey‚Äôs notes say that Mr. Trump raised concerns about the Steele Dossier and said he needed loyalty from his F.B.I. director. This question touches on Mr. Trump‚Äôs true motivation for firing Mr. Comey: Was he dismissed because he was not loyal and would not shut down an F.B.I. investigation? What was the purpose of your Feb. 14, 2017, meeting with Mr. Comey, and what was said? That was a key moment. Mr. Comey testified that the president told him, ‚ÄúI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.‚Äù Mr. Trump has denied this. What did you know about the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation into Mr. Flynn and Russia in the days leading up to Mr. Comey‚Äôs testimony on March 20, 2017? Mr. Comey‚Äôs testimony publicly confirmed that the F.B.I. was investigating members of the Trump campaign for possible coordination with Russia. Mr. Mueller wants to know what role that revelation played in Mr. Comey‚Äôs firing. What did you do in reaction to the March 20 testimony? Describe your contacts with intelligence officials. In the aftermath, The Post reported, Mr. Trump asked the United States‚Äô top intelligence official, Daniel Coats, to pressure Mr. Comey to back off his investigation. Mr. Mueller wants to ask Mr. Trump about his contacts with Mr. Coats as well as the C.I.A.‚Äôs director at the time, Mike Pompeo, and the National Security Agency‚Äôs director, Michael S. Rogers. The conversations could reflect Mr. Trump‚Äôs growing frustration with Mr. Comey ‚Äî not about the Clinton case, but about his refusal to shut down the Russia inquiry. What did you think and do in reaction to the news that the special counsel was speaking to Mr. Rogers, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Coats? It is not clear whether Mr. Mueller knows something specific about Mr. Trump‚Äôs reaction to these interviews, but the question shows that Mr. Mueller is keenly interested in how Mr. Trump responded to each step of his investigation. What was the purpose of your calls to Mr. Comey on March 30 and April 11, 2017? Mr. Comey said that Mr. Trump called twice to ask him to say publicly that he was not under F.B.I. investigation. In the second call, Mr. Comey said, the president added: ‚ÄúI have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know.‚Äù What was the purpose of your April 11, 2017, statement to Maria Bartiromo? While the White House ultimately said Mr. Comey was fired for breaking with Justice Department policy and discussing the Clinton investigation, Mr. Trump expressed no such qualms in an interview with Ms. Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. ‚ÄúDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf he weren‚Äôt, she would be, right now, going to trial.‚Äù What did you think and do about Mr. Comey‚Äôs May 3, 2017, testimony? In this Senate appearance, Mr. Comey described his handling of the Clinton investigation in detail. Mr. Comey was fired soon after. Mr. Mueller‚Äôs question suggests he wants to know why Mr. Trump soured. Regarding the decision to fire Mr. Comey: When was it made? Why? Who played a role? Over the past several months, Mr. Mueller has asked White House officials for the back story, and whether the public justification was accurate. He will be able to compare Mr. Trump‚Äôs answers to what he has learned elsewhere. What did you mean when you told Russian diplomats on May 10, 2017, that firing Mr. Comey had taken the pressure off? The day after Mr. Comey‚Äôs firing, Mr. Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office. There, The Times revealed, Mr. Trump suggested he had fired Mr. Comey because of the pressure from the Russia investigation. ‚ÄúI just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. ‚ÄúI faced great pressure because of Russia. That‚Äôs taken off.‚Äù What did you mean in your interview with Lester Holt about Mr. Comey and Russia? Shortly after firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump undercut his own argument when he told NBC News that he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey. I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it. And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself ‚Äî I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won. What was the purpose of your May 12, 2017, tweet? After The Times revealed the president‚Äôs private dinner with Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter. Mr. Comey appeared unworried. ‚ÄúLordy, I hope there are tapes,‚Äù Mr. Comey said. The White House ultimately said that, no, there were no tapes. What did you think about Mr. Comey‚Äôs June 8, 2017, testimony regarding Mr. Flynn, and what did you do about it? After he was fired, Mr. Comey testified about his conversations with Mr. Trump and described him as preoccupied with the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation into Russia. After the testimony, Mr. Trump called him a liar. What was the purpose of the September and October 2017 statements, including tweets, regarding an investigation of Mr. Comey? Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Comey had testified falsely to Congress and suggested that the Justice Department might investigate. Mr. Trump followed up with tweets suggesting that he should be investigated for rigging an inquiry into Mrs. Clinton. Such comments reinforced criticism that Mr. Trump views the Justice Department as a sword to use against his political rivals. What is the reason for your continued criticism of Mr. Comey and his former deputy, Andrew G. McCabe? Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe are among Mr. Trump‚Äôs favorite targets. Mr. McCabe is a lifelong Republican, but Mr. Trump has criticized him as a Clinton loyalist because Mr. McCabe‚Äôs wife, a Democrat, ran unsuccessfully for office in Virginia and received donations from a Clinton ally. This question suggests that Mr. Mueller wants to know whether Mr. Trump‚Äôs criticism is an effort to damage the F.B.I. while it investigates the president‚Äôs associates. What did you think and do regarding the recusal of Mr. Sessions? Mr. Trump has criticized Mr. Sessions‚Äôs recusal from the Russia investigation. The Times reported that Mr. Trump humiliated him in an Oval Office meeting and accused him of being disloyal. Mr. Sessions ultimately submitted his resignation, though Mr. Trump did not accept it. Along with the next two questions, this inquiry looks at whether Mr. Trump views law enforcement officials as protectors. What efforts did you make to try to get him to change his mind? The Times has reported that Mr. Trump told his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, to stop Mr. Sessions from recusing himself. Mr. McGahn was unsuccessful, and Mr. Trump erupted, saying he needed an attorney general who would protect him. Did you discuss whether Mr. Sessions would protect you, and reference past attorneys general? Mr. Trump has spoken affectionately about past attorneys general who he said were loyal to their presidents. He cited Robert F. Kennedy and Eric H. Holder Jr. as examples. ‚ÄúHolder protected the president,‚Äù he said in a Times interview in December. ‚ÄúAnd I have great respect for that.‚Äù What did you think and what did you do in reaction to the news of the appointment of the special counsel? In a twist, Mr. Mueller‚Äôs very appointment has become part of his investigation. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced the inquiry as a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù Mr. Trump blames the appointment on Mr. Sessions‚Äôs recusal. Why did you hold Mr. Sessions‚Äôs resignation until May 31, 2017, and with whom did you discuss it? Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Sessions‚Äôs resignation after aides argued that it would only create more problems. The details of those discussions remain unclear, but Mr. Trump‚Äôs advisers have already given Mr. Mueller their accounts of the conversations. What discussions did you have with Reince Priebus in July 2017 about obtaining the Sessions resignation? With whom did you discuss it? Mr. Priebus, who was Mr. Trump‚Äôs chief of staff, has said he raced out of the White House after Mr. Sessions and implored him not to resign. Mr. Mueller has interviewed Mr. Priebus and would be able to compare his answers with those of Mr. Trump. What discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel, and what did you do when that consideration was reported in January 2018? Again, Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation intersects with its own existence. The Times reported that, in June 2017, Mr. Trump ordered Mr. McGahn to fire Mr. Mueller. Mr. McGahn refused. Though Mr. Trump‚Äôs own advisers informed Mr. Mueller about that effort, Mr. Trump denied it: ‚ÄúFake news,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA typical New York Times fake story.‚Äù What was the purpose of your July 2017 criticism of Mr. Sessions? Mr. Trump unleashed a series of attacks on Mr. Sessions in July. When did you become aware of the Trump Tower meeting? This and other questions relate to a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer who offered political dirt about Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump‚Äôs eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., arranged the meeting. He said he did not tell his father about it when it happened. What involvement did you have in the communication strategy, including the release of Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs emails? When The Times found out about the meeting, Mr. Trump helped draft a misleading statement in his son‚Äôs name, omitting the true purpose of the meeting. After The Times obtained the younger Mr. Trump‚Äôs emails, he published them on Twitter. During a 2013 trip to Russia, what communication and relationships did you have with the Agalarovs and Russian government officials? The Trump Tower meeting was arranged through the Russian singer Emin Agalarov, his billionaire father, Aras Agalarov, and a music promoter. Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing the nature of connections between the Agalarovs, Mr. Trump and Russian officials. What communication did you have with Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater and others, including foreign nationals, about Russian real estate developments during the campaign? Mr. Mueller is referring to a failed effort to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mr. Sater, a business associate, proposed the idea to Mr. Cohen, the longtime personal lawyer to Mr. Trump. Emails show that Mr. Sater believed that the project would showcase Mr. Trump‚Äôs deal-making acumen and propel him into the presidency. What discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with Mr. Putin? Did you discuss it with others? Journalists and lawmakers have uncovered several examples of Russian officials trying, through intermediaries, to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Senior campaign officials rejected some overtures, but Mr. Trump‚Äôs involvement has been a mystery. What discussions did you have during the campaign regarding Russian sanctions? Even as the Obama administration stepped up sanctions on Russia, Mr. Trump struck a laudatory tone toward Mr. Putin. What involvement did you have concerning platform changes regarding arming Ukraine? A portion of the Republican platform was changed in a way more favorable to Russia. During the campaign, what did you know about Russian hacking, use of social media or other acts aimed at the campaign? This is a key question. Mr. Trump praised the release of hacked Democratic emails and called on Russia to find others. Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation has unearthed evidence that at least one member of Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign ‚Äî George Papadopoulos ‚Äî was told that Russia had obtained compromising emails about Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly said there was ‚Äúno collusion‚Äù with the Russian government. What knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign? This is one of the most intriguing questions on the list. It is not clear whether Mr. Mueller knows something new, but there is no publicly available information linking Mr. Manafort, the former campaign chairman, to such outreach. So his inclusion here is significant. Mr. Manafort‚Äôs longtime colleague, Rick Gates, is cooperating with Mr. Mueller. What did you know about communication between Roger Stone, his associates, Julian Assange or WikiLeaks? Mr. Stone, a longtime adviser, claimed to have inside information from WikiLeaks, which published hacked Democratic emails. He appeared to predict future releases, and was in touch with a Twitter account used by Russian intelligence. This question, along with the next two, show that Mr. Mueller is still investigating possible campaign cooperation with Russia. What did you know during the transition about an attempt to establish back-channel communication to Russia, and Jared Kushner‚Äôs efforts? Mr. Kushner, Mr. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law, has testified that the Russian ambassador proposed getting Mr. Flynn in contact with Russian officials to discuss Syria. In response, Mr. Kushner said, he proposed using secure phones inside the Russian Embassy ‚Äî a highly unusual suggestion that was not accepted.  What do you know about a 2017 meeting in Seychelles involving Erik Prince? The meeting was convened by Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates. It brought Mr. Prince, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump‚Äôs team, together with a Russian investor close to Mr. Putin. What do you know about a Ukrainian peace proposal provided to Mr. Cohen in 2017? Mr. Cohen, the lawyer, hand-delivered to the White House a peace proposal for Ukraine and Russia. This unusual bit of backdoor diplomacy is of interest because it involved a Ukrainian lawmaker who said he was being encouraged by Mr. Putin‚Äôs aides. Mr. Cohen has said he did not discuss the proposal with Mr. Trump. Matt Apuzzo is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter based in Washington.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board The acting director of the F.B.I., Andrew McCabe, told Congress on Thursday that President Trump‚Äôs firing of James Comey has not derailed the agency‚Äôs investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Which is good news. Despite Mr. Trump‚Äôs assertion that the idea of collusion is ‚Äúa total hoax,‚Äù and despite many unknowns, the links continue to pile up. Here is a partial accounting of the connections we do know something about. THE TRUMP FAMILY BUSINESS  There may be no Trump Tower in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but it is not for lack of trying. Mr. Trump and his family have sought to do business in Russia since at least the 1980s. They have also developed extensive commercial and personal relationships with politically connected Russian businessmen. In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. told a real estate conference, ‚ÄúRussians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York,‚Äù according to eTurboNews, a travel industry news site.  The author James Dodson said that another son, Eric Trump, told him in 2013 that Russians have bankrolled Trump golf courses: ‚ÄúWell, we don‚Äôt rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.‚Äù Eric Trump denies saying that. In addition, Donald Trump worked with the Agalarov family, a prominent Russian business group, to host the 2013 edition of his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Mr. Trump met more than a dozen of the country‚Äôs most prominent oligarchs while he was there, Bloomberg News reported. Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump and is a senior adviser to the president, has also been caught up in the Russia story. During the transition, Mr. Kushner met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, as well as with the top executive of a Russian government-owned bank. The world would know much more about Mr. Trump‚Äôs foreign partnerships if he had released his tax returns, as every president has done for the last 40 years. MICHAEL FLYNN Mr. Flynn, the former national security adviser, had several conversations with Mr. Kislyak during the transition in which they discussed American sanctions against Russia. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn after public disclosure that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of those talks. In addition, RT, a Russian government-backed news outlet, paid Mr. Flynn $45,000 for giving a speech in December 2015 in Moscow. On the same trip, he sat next to President Vladimir Putin at an RT gala. The Pentagon is investigating whether Mr. Flynn, a retired military intelligence officer, failed to disclose and obtain approval from the State and Defense Departments before taking money from a foreign government. JEFF SESSIONS Mr. Sessions, the attorney general, said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he did not have any contacts with Russian officials while he was actively campaigning for Mr. Trump. In fact, he met with Mr. Kislyak twice, once in his Senate office and once at the Republican National Convention. PAUL MANAFORT Mr. Manafort, a former chairman of the Trump campaign, worked as a consultant for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine and for Ukraine‚Äôs former president, Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by the Kremlin. Mr. Manafort has been accused of receiving secret payments from the pro-Russia party. About a decade earlier, Mr. Manafort also worked for Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to Mr. Putin. The Associated Press obtained a memo he wrote to Mr. Deripaska offering a plan that he said would ‚Äúgreatly benefit the Putin Government.‚Äù CARTER PAGE American officials believe that Mr. Page, a foreign policy adviser, had contacts with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign. He also gave a pro-Russia speech in Moscow in July 2016. Mr. Page was once employed by Merrill Lynch‚Äôs Moscow office, where he worked with Gazprom, a government-owned energy giant. ROGER STONE Mr. Stone, an informal but close Trump adviser, exchanged messages last summer with Guccifer 2.0, a Twitter account widely believed to be a front for Russian intelligence operatives who were involved in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. During the campaign, Mr. Stone seemed to know in advance that WikiLeaks would release emails from the account of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman. Mr. Trump and his associates can cry themselves hoarse that there is neither smoke nor fire here. But all in all, the known facts suggest an unusually extensive network of relationships with a major foreign power. Anyone who cares about the credibility of the American electoral process should want a thorough investigation of whether and how Russia interfered in the election and through whom.

Business,"Advertisement By ANA SWANSON and MILAN SCHREUERAPRIL 21, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî The European Union and Mexico on Saturday announced a major update to their existing free trade pact signed nearly two decades ago, a development that will allow almost all goods, including agricultural products, to move between Europe and Mexico duty-free. The deal, which has yet to be formally signed, is expected to increase trade in dairy, pork, services, digital goods and medicines between the economies. It will also give Mexico greater access to an advanced consumer market, as negotiations with the Trump administration over the modernization of the North American Free Trade Agreement still appear to be on uncertain ground. And it sends a message to Mr. Trump that some of America‚Äôs closest trading partners are moving ahead with deals of their own ‚Äî potentially leaving American exporters on the losing end in foreign markets. In its announcement, Mexico said the agreement would help modernize its existing commercial relationship. Advertisement Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said in a statement that ‚Äútrade can and should be a win-win process and today‚Äôs agreement shows just that.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWith this agreement, Mexico joins Canada, Japan and Singapore in the growing list of partners willing to work with the E.U. in defending open, fair and rules-based trade.‚Äù Advertisement The European Union and Mexico said they had reached an agreement in principle on the most important elements of the agreement, with some technical details yet to be resolved. They are aiming to finalize it by year‚Äôs end, after which it must be ratified by the European Parliament and the Mexican Senate. The original trade pact, signed in 1997, was relatively narrow, mainly eliminating tariffs on cars and machinery. The deal came into force in 2000 and was the first free trade pact between Europe and a Latin American country. What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Since then, the European Union has added 13 members, and the internet has dramatically changed global business. In May 2016, the countries started negotiations to update the pact. The revised deal adds in a variety of new rules governing agricultural goods, telecommunications, digital trade, intellectual property, climate change, anti-corruption measures, finance and energy. The deal is particularly notable for giving Mexico access to another wealthy market similar to the United States. The European Union is Mexico‚Äôs second-biggest export market after the United States. Yet it is a distant second to the United States, where roughly 80 percent of Mexican exports go. Mr. Trump has called those close economic ties into question by starting an ambitious renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta negotiators say they may be close to finalizing a deal in the coming weeks. But much uncertainty remains, as the United States, Mexico and Canada continue to advocate for vastly different measures. Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based research organization, said that Mr. Trump‚Äôs aggressive posture on trade had pushed Mexico toward negotiations with Europe. ‚ÄúThe E.U. has for at least 10 years been knocking on the door of Mexico to upgrade the trade agreement, and it is only very recently that they have come along,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfectly obvious that what has prompted them to change their minds is Donald Trump.‚Äù Advertisement Both Europe and Mexico have actively been pushing forward with new trade deals amid a global resurgence of skepticism about the benefits of free trade. Mexico remains part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal that President Trump criticized and withdrew from on his fourth day in office. The remaining members, including Canada, Japan, Australia and Chile, signed a deal without the United States in March. Mexico is also negotiating with Argentina and Brazil, and has sought out potential alternatives to purchases of American grain and meat if Nafta were to fall apart. The European Union now has close ties with both of America‚Äôs Nafta partners, after a new pact with Canada went into force in September.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributors By Fred Launay and John E. Scanlon Just seven years ago in India‚Äôs magnificent Manas National Park, there were no tigers to speak of, just a few remnants of a population wiped out after decades of civil unrest that left the park‚Äôs wildlife vulnerable to persecution. Now there are more than 30 tigers in Manas, a remarkable recovery achieved in record time thanks to a robust collaboration among the Indian Forest Department, local and international nongovernmental organizations, and law enforcement agencies, all working together to secure the park and protect it from poachers. The success in Manas shows that stopping poaching at the source can bring tigers back from the brink. But toppling the illegal trade in big cats and their parts requires coordinated action on a global scale: enacting and enforcing strict laws that criminalize wildlife trafficking; providing livelihoods for marginalized communities coerced by criminal poaching gangs to do their dirty work; and, as quickly as possible, reducing demand for big cats and their body parts by aiming at drivers like fashion and traditional medicine. It also requires that we prioritize saving the big cats for their intrinsic value as apex predators, critical species we would be the poorer for losing, ecologically, economically, culturally and morally. In the past 25 years, saving species has become less of a focus of the world‚Äôs policymakers than solving climate change. During this time, the resources needed to address the immediate threats to wildlife have not kept pace with the growing scale of these threats, and already pressured species like the big cats have become even more vulnerable to poaching and human encroachment. The argument is that addressing climate change is the most important thing we can do to preserve all life on our planet. But we also need to consider temporal factors. We can and must simultaneously address the interlinked imperatives of mitigating climate change and stemming the extinction crisis playing out right now. If not, by the time we achieve the 2050 goals of the Paris climate accord, it will be too late for the planet‚Äôs big cats. Worldwide, wild populations of cheetahs, clouded leopards, jaguars, leopards, lions, pumas, snow leopards and tigers have fallen at alarming rates, with much of the decline in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, subspecies continue to blink out on our watch. A newly published study of the Indochinese leopard in Eastern Cambodia, the last remaining population in all of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, showed a 72 percent decline in just the past five years. We estimate that there now are fewer than 100 leopards, signaling that local extinction could be just around the corner. The tiger recovery in Manas is working because intensive efforts have been brought to bear there to stop poaching and to disrupt the illegal wildlife supply chain. Remote camera traps placed covertly throughout the park capture images of passers-by and relay these photos in real time to law enforcement officials, who use the photos and other intelligence to identify wildlife poachers. This enables limited resources to be deployed efficiently: Specially trained rangers can pinpoint the poachers‚Äô exact locations to set up ambushes and arrest them, while local aid groups focus on training community members in skills like farming, food preparation and weaving to reduce their dependence on forest products, an approach that‚Äôs proved effective in discouraging wood-gathering, fishing and other illegal activities in the park. These strategies are succeeding in some of the world‚Äôs most heavily poached landscapes. Tiger populations are recovering at key sites in Nepal, Thailand and Indonesia, and there is now hope for critically endangered lions in West Africa, where the poaching of their prey is one of the biggest threats. Big cats are resilient, but so are the criminals poaching them. In Bolivia, where jaguar hunting has been outlawed since the 1975 treaty on the international trade in endangered species banned the global trade of the animals‚Äô coveted pelts, reports of a resurgence in jaguar killings have recently emerged. The journal Nature has reported that between August 2014 and February 2015, Bolivian authorities confiscated 186 jaguar fangs from packages bound for Asia. Radio ads broadcast in parts of the country offer $100 to $150 for jaguar fangs, most likely for necklaces to be sold as trinkets. Experts worry that as tiger parts become harder to obtain, a new illicit trade in jaguar parts will take hold. Conservation teams stationed in poaching hot spots are best positioned to anticipate emerging threats like these and respond quickly. Front line officers are striving to stay one step ahead of the criminals with counterintelligence; elite ranger training; and advanced technology borrowed from police and the military like night vision equipment, thermal drones and forensic genetics. Despite the insatiable and ever-changing demand for big cats and their parts, conservation groups and law enforcement agencies working together across the entire illegal supply chain ‚Äî from source to transit to destination ‚Äî have proved that they can disrupt the criminal networks that lie behind these serious crimes. Arrests, prosecutions and convictions of poachers are on the rise, and big cat populations ‚Äî where diligently protected ‚Äî are on the rebound. As the results in Manas show, a focused effort on locking down key tiger sites can increase tiger populations. A 2010 study by some of the world‚Äôs leading tiger experts suggested that it is relatively inexpensive to protect tiger sites effectively. Adjusted for current conditions ‚Äî and excluding the investment already being made by governments, particularly India, as well as by international donors and nongovernmental organizations ‚Äî it would take about another $50 million a year to secure the 50 or so remaining recoverable tiger sites across Asia. The same strategy of securing key protected areas can slow the killing of Africa‚Äôs rapidly dwindling lions, cheetahs and leopards, and the vast array of wildlife that shares those landscapes. A 2015 analysis estimated that effectively managing the more than 250 most important public protected areas for Africa‚Äôs cats would cost $1.25 billion a year. This is where governments, aid organizations, banks, corporations and other deep-pocketed funders must step forward and invest in conservation at the scale needed to secure the vast wild places big cats need to roam, hunt and breed. Last fall, researchers at Oxford University unveiled the first evidence-based model to illustrate how increased investment in conservation spending can lead to quantifiable improvements in biodiversity. The model used past data to show that global conservation spending between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss by an average of 29 percent, and that countries that spent more had better outcomes. The researchers hope that the ability to quantify the effectiveness of conservation spending and predict future outcomes will help guide budget decisions and lead to the funding increases needed to prevent extinction of species. We hope so, too. Or perhaps such decisions will be driven by something less measurable: the value of these revered and critical predators as protectors of our planet‚Äôs wild landscapes and the life within them. Either way, let it not be said that we did too little, too late. With a collective commitment to adequately protecting their landscapes now, big cats could be on the road to recovery and organized wildlife criminals on the path to extinction.

Here we have a presidential candidate‚Äôs son meeting with a representative of America‚Äôs chief enemy, a representative of a government that is inimical to every democratic value that we like to think is the basis of American exceptionalism. The apparent purpose of the meeting was to gather information to sway the election, and the son says it soon became evident that the Russian lawyer had no information (can you not almost hear the disappointment?). Perhaps this does not meet the legal definition of collusion, but it meets one of the oldest human tests of corruption: It stinks. NATHAN COHEN, LARKSPUR, CALIF. To the Editor: Re ‚ÄúTrump Team Met Russian Offering Dirt on Clinton‚Äù (front page, July 10): The true agenda all along, says Donald Trump Jr., was the adoption of Russian babies, banned by the Kremlin in retaliation for American sanctions. But why would a Russian lawyer resort to a sleazy-sounding trick to get a meeting about a humanitarian topic, and why would she try for Donald Trump Jr.? Did he have any known interest in the issue? And why would the contact not wait out the campaign and simply meet openly with a relevant person in the administration after the hoped-for election of President Trump? Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs feeble explanation was quickly changed, but its brief existence insulted our intelligence. E.

No Russian intelligence official stood outside my polling place offering me a bribe or threatened me to vote against Hillary Clinton. I did that all on my own. I wonder what was told to Hillary Clinton in those 30,000 emails that were erased from her private, secret and unauthorized email server. Where were your investigative reporters on that story? ANTONIA TAMPLIN, BRONX To the Editor: The reason that evidence of collusion, no matter how strong, will not elicit any real response from congressional Republicans is this: Their party‚Äôs base believes that if it took the Kremlin to keep Hillary Clinton out of the White House and to get Donald Trump in, fine.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Worried about someone hacking the next election? Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal information? The technology industry has an answer called the blockchain ‚Äî even for the problems the industry helped to create. The first blockchain was created in 2009 as a new kind of database for the virtual currency Bitcoin, where all transactions could be stored without any banks or governments involved. Now, countless entrepreneurs, companies and governments are looking to use similar databases ‚Äî often independent of Bitcoin ‚Äî to solve some of the most intractable issues facing society. ‚ÄúPeople feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data,‚Äù said Ryan Shea, a co-founder of Blockstack, a New York company working with blockchain technology. The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, has said the blockchain could help reduce the big internet companies‚Äô influence and return the web to his original vision. But he has also warned that it could come with some of the same problems as the web. Blockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority. In theory, this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hacked. Investors, for one, see potential. While the price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have plummeted this year, investment in other blockchain projects has remained strong. In the first three months of 2018, venture capitalists put half a billion dollars into 75 blockchain projects, more than double what they raised in the last quarter of 2017, according to data from Pitchbook. Most of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing, and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting. But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things, like the way we vote and the way we interact online. ‚ÄúThere is just so much it can do,‚Äù said Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects. ‚ÄúI love the fact that you can transmit data, information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack ‚Äî really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficient.‚Äù Mr. Tusk, the founder of Tusk Strategies, is an investor in some large virtual currency companies. He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchain-based systems. Mr. Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamper-proof way. ‚ÄúEverything is moving toward people saying, ‚ÄòI want all the benefits of the internet, but I want to protect my privacy and my security,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchain.‚Äù Blockchains assemble data into so-called blocks that are chained together using complicated math. Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps, any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated. In the original Bitcoin blockchain, the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions. The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain ‚Äî and most of its imitators ‚Äî are kept by a peer-to-peer computer network. The novel structure allows people to set up online accounts that can securely hold valuable personal information without having to trust a single entity that can hoard, abuse or lose control of the data, as happened with Facebook and the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax. A range of corporations and governments are trying to apply the blockchain model ‚Äî for projects from the prosaic to the radical. Various departments of the United Nations now have blockchain experiments looking to tackle climate change, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the identity challenges faced by stateless people. Coca-Cola and the State Department recently announced a project to register foreign employees on a blockchain in an attempt to eliminate forced labor. These experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados, who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with old-fashioned databases. Other critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry: a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly tested. ‚ÄúThe blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say, ‚ÄòYes, we are the solution,‚Äô and they have every incentive to do so,‚Äù said Angela Walch, a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. ‚ÄúBut somebody needs to ask the question: ‚ÄòIs it actually better? Is it measurably better?‚Äô‚Äù Many blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through so-called initial coin offerings last year. These fund-raising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversight. But new blockchain efforts continue apace, motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTube. Most of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements. This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data ‚Äî as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles. And start-ups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their hands. Blockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of it. The animating force behind the project is that users ‚Äî rather than Blockstack or any other company ‚Äî would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online service. Blockstack is one of several blockchain-based projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that don‚Äôt rely on having unfettered access to our personal information. The idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebook‚Äôs relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke, Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchain-based alternatives. ‚ÄúAs Facebook is collapsing we need to replace it with a blockchain based, decentralized platform!‚Äù one user, @GerdMoeBehrens, wrote. ‚Äú#blockchain WE NEED U NOW!!!‚Äù wrote another, @andymartin46. But Mr. Berners-Lee has warned that the development of the blockchain could come with unintended consequences, like more activity from criminals operating outside the oversight of governments. Even blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand, when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly develop. In fact, most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy. For example, the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data ‚Äî details of the transactions between users ‚Äî to be seen by anyone, even if other data ‚Äî the users‚Äô identities ‚Äî remains obscured. Voting start-ups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain, but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concerns. Blockchain-based accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys, which people are famously bad at doing. With Bitcoin, when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account ‚Äî if someone lost the private key to a blockchain-based online account, they could lose access to their identity. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems,‚Äù said Michael Casey, a co-author of ‚ÄúThe Truth Machine,‚Äù a new book on the blockchain. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we face.‚Äù Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî The embattled political data firm Cambridge Analytica quietly sought to develop its own virtual currency in recent months through a so-called initial coin offering, a novel fund-raising method that has come under growing scrutiny by financial regulators around the world. The offering was part of a broader, but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last year. Much like its acquisition of Facebook data to build psychological profiles of voters, the new business line pushed the firm into murky ethical and legal situations. Documents and emails obtained by The New York Times show that Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs efforts to help promote another group‚Äôs digital token, the Dragon Coin, associated the firm with a famous gangster in Macau who has gone by the nickname Broken Tooth. The goal of Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs own coin offering? Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers, Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, said in an interview. The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users. ‚ÄúWho knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica?‚Äù Ms. Kaiser said. ‚ÄúSo why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that works?‚Äù The effort was overseen by Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs British chief executive, Alexander Nix, who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his company‚Äôs approach to political work in other countries, including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents. The Facebook data revelations and Mr. Nix‚Äôs comments appear to have put the virtual currency work, which was still in the early stages, on hold. Initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, are a method of fund-raising in which companies sell their own virtual currencies. The tokens are generally structured like Bitcoin, using a so-called blockchain to record transactions. The coins are usually designed to be used as an internal payment method in software that the start-ups are building. Over the last year, companies have raised over $6 billion through I.C.O.s. Coin offerings generally avoid the regulatory oversight that accompanies traditional fund-raising methods, opening the door for significant fraud. A number of coin offerings have been shut down by law enforcement, and there are several broad investigations of the industry by regulators around the world. ‚ÄúThere are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,‚Äù said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Cambridge Analytica began working with coin offerings in the middle of last year. The business was guided by Ms. Kaiser, an American who led the company‚Äôs business development and previously appeared at a press event with organizers of the ‚ÄúBrexit‚Äù campaign to get Britain out of the European Union. Cambridge Analytica boasts that its ‚Äúpsychographic profiles‚Äù of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was ‚Äúhelping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.‚Äù Jill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended. Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook. She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates. Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,‚Äù she said. Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser‚Äôs team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures. Cambridge Analytica had little public role in promoting Dragon Coin. But behind the scenes the company emailed potential partners and investors and arranged for some of them to take all-expenses-paid trips to a glitzy Dragon Coin event in Macau. The South China Morning Post published a photo from the event showing Wan Kuok-koi in attendance. Mr. Wan is known as Broken Tooth Koi from his days as the leader of the famous 14K gang in Macau. He was released from prison in 2012 after serving a 14-year term. The founder of Dragon Coin, Chris Ahmad, told Business Insider at the time that Mr. Wan ‚Äúis not involved in Dragon, and he is not financing Dragon in any way.‚Äù But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin‚Äôs co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project. When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a ‚Äúhypothetical wish list‚Äù of a ‚Äújunior staff‚Äù member. ‚ÄúWe will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,‚Äù he said. Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project. Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises. The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued. The documents last summer also said the Dragon app, which would let investors use its virtual coin, would be available in September. When that didn‚Äôt happen, the company promised the app in January ‚Äî but it still has not appeared. In the meantime, the company has spent its money sponsoring a Formula E car racing team and a team climbing Mount Everest. The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company‚Äôs New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum‚Äôs annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event. He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of ‚Äî the abuse of online personal data. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,‚Äù Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. ‚ÄúAnd that is only possible through the blockchain.‚Äù The virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors. The company wrote a document describing the technical specifications of the coin, Ms. Kaiser said. Her account was confirmed by another person who worked on the project and agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. The work was overseen by Alexander Tayler, the firm‚Äôs chief data scientist and briefly the interim chief executive after Mr. Nix stepped down. Ms. Kaiser left Cambridge Analytica in February and has been sharply critical of the company since then. As far as she knows, the coin offering has not moved forward. But she is still working on similar concepts at her new consulting firm, Bueno Capital. Follow Nathaniel Popper and Nicholas Confessore on Twitter: @nathanielpopper and @nickconfessore.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters LONDON/NEW YORK/SINGAPORE ‚Äî After bouncing up, falling down and keeping investors on the edges of their seats, bitcoin may be maturing into a period of relatively boring stability, experts say. A worldwide wave of regulation has led to a collapse in trading volumes. Cryptocurrency advertisements are disappearing from top internet pages, and bitcoin no longer dominates Google searches. As investors try to figure out what bitcoin wants to be when it grows up, the best-known cryptocurrency is going through somewhat of an existential crisis.  ""It needs a new narrative,"" said Nicholas Colas, New York-based founder of investment research firm DataTrek. ""There is every chance that if there is some sort of institutional involvement, there could be a move higher."" Bitcoin rallied 25 percent in April after crashing 70 percent from a high near $20,000 late last year. The cryptocurrency landscape has indeed changed. Mom-and-pop investors who drove bitcoin's skyrocket rise in 2017 have been pushed aside by government bans on trading, and replaced by cryptocurrency funds, wealthy individuals and established financial firms. The bigger players can make bigger moves, but their trades are often obscured by screens on over-the-counter (OTC) brokerages and matching platforms. They are also less likely to chase sudden swings in bitcoin's value, being more interested in the potential of unproven but promising blockchain technology. Average daily traded volumes across cryptocurrency exchanges fell to $9.1 billion in March and to $7.4 billion in the first half of April, compared with almost $17 billion in December, according to data compiled by crypto analysis website CryptoCompare. Several exchanges saw their daily trading volumes drop by more than half between December and March, including Bitfinex, Poloniex, Coinbase and Bitstamp, the data shows.  Cryptocurrencies' biggest-ever trading day was Dec. 22, when volumes topped $30 billion, according to CryptoCompare. On April 8, volume sagged to $4.6 billion, the weakest day since last October, according to the data.  (For a graphic on cryptocurrency volumes click https://reut.rs/2Jd5W3R) RESHAPING THE MARKET The theory that bigger institutions will make bitcoin markets less volatile and more liquid has grown as new OTC exchanges and platforms spring up, carrying names such as Circle, Octagon Strategy, Cumberland and Kraken. Digital exchange Gemini's new block trading product allows high-volume trades that will be invisible to other traders until the orders are filled. Cumberland, one of the biggest block traders, has counterparties in more than 35 countries and quotes two-way prices in about 35 crypto assets.  Gatecoin, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, saw retail volumes plunge from peaks of $100 million a day last September, said Aurelien Menant, its founder and chief executive. But, he said, as institutional players enter the market, OTC trades hidden from view have pushed up overall volumes in a way that doesn't show up in data. Gatecoin also operates an OTC platform.  Few institutions have gone public about their plans to trade cryptocurrencies, and many asset managers say they still aren't sure the digital currency is more than a fad.  But a Thomson Reuters survey this week found one in five financial institutions is considering trading cryptocurrencies in the next 12 months. Of those, 70 percent said they planned to start trading in the next three to six months. In the meantime, the price of bitcoin may be stabilizing, at least on paper. The futures market <BTCc1> shows bitcoin staying nearly flat - between $8,900 and $9,050 - until September. Gatecoin's Menant, however, is considerably more bullish. He reckons the currency might end the year above $100,000, but acknowledges that's a gamble.  UNDERLYING VALUE Joe Duncan, founder of Singapore-based Fintech firm Duncan Capital, expects to see retail investors return to trading as governments slowly relax their cryptocurrency rules. ""But bitcoin could still lose some market dominance,"" Duncan said. Thomas Lee, managing partner and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors in New York, said the bitcoin market is languishing in a ""purgatory"" phase somewhere between a bear and a bull market. He predicted that could continue until at least September.  One issue is that although many of the big institutions are curious about how bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology could revolutionize the financial sector, bitcoin isn't widely accepted as currency and has no intrinsic value.  That, and the currency's intense volatility, make it challenging for investors to forecast a price.  Some analysts think bitcoin will retain a premium as a security, like gold, in the digital world, while other cryptocurrencies are used for commerce. Others see it as just another asset.  ""One of the reasons to own cryptocurrencies is because they are an effective hedge,"" said Sam Doctor, a data analyst at New York-based Fundstrat, a research firm whose founder is a well-known bitcoin bull predicting large rises this year. ""Until something happens to disprove that thesis, you aren't looking to sell them so long as other asset classes are falling.""

Sports,"Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAJUNE 6, 2017  CLEVELAND ‚Äî The Cleveland Cavaliers are in trouble. Overwhelming, intimidating trouble. Even LeBron James, whose vast postseason repertory includes some previous escape acts, does not dispute that fact. ‚ÄúYou hate to continue to put yourself in these positions,‚Äù he said on Tuesday as he and his teammates practiced ‚Äî what else were they supposed to do? ‚Äî in preparation for a foreboding Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals on Wednesday night. Which is when they will again go up against a Golden State Warriors team that has yet to lose in this year‚Äôs postseason and needs just two more victories to conclude a historic 16-0 playoff run. Not only did the Cavaliers lose the first two games of this series by a wide margin, but they also left little reason for people to think that Game 3 will be all that different ‚Äî even though it will be played in front of their fans after the Game 1 and Game 2 wipeouts in Oakland, Calif. After all, James played well in the first two games, and in the end, it did not matter a bit. The lethal combination of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant ‚Äî a factor the Cavaliers did not have to cope with in last year‚Äôs finals, when they also lost the first two games but rallied to beat the Warriors, anyway ‚Äî was just too much. Advertisement Still, free of charge, here is a suggestion box of things Cleveland might try to turn this series around. Advertisement  CUT THE MISTAKES The Warriors‚Äô offense tends to overshadow their equally amazing defense. During the regular season, they led the N.B.A. in defensive field-goal percentage, defensive 3-point field-goal percentage, steals and blocked shots. Throughout the playoffs, they have continued to use their defense to fuel their offense ‚Äî by pummeling their opponents in transition. In Game 1 of the finals, the Warriors forced the Cavaliers into committing 20 turnovers. The Warriors generated 21 points off those miscues. They won the game by 22 points. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the best in the league at turning your mistakes into makes,‚Äù Greg Anthony, a studio analyst for NBA TV, said in a telephone interview. The Cavaliers took better care of the basketball in Game 2, but the margin for error against the Warriors is slim. On Tuesday, James recalled in vivid detail the point in Game 2 when it all fell apart for the Cavaliers ‚Äî a third-quarter sequence in which he committed an ill-advised foul and then threw a bad pass. The Warriors expanded their lead from 4 points to 10. ‚ÄúJust can‚Äôt make bad plays against a team that‚Äôs that great,‚Äù James said. SLOW IT DOWN Mike Fratello, a former Cavaliers coach, has watched the Warriors run wild in the first two games. He said he would try to slow them down by having the Cavaliers be more judicious. ‚ÄúWhen you know the other team runs and scores way more than you do, at a high, up-tempo pace, do you keep doing it, or do you make adjustments?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúMaybe you should be using 20 to 22, 23 seconds every possession. If you don‚Äôt have a two-on-one or three-on-one fast-break opportunity, run some clock. Pass the ball five or six times and make the Warriors defend for longer stretches.‚Äù For his part, James said the Cavaliers would resist changing their style of play on offense ‚Äî or at least that was what he was saying for public consumption. Advertisement ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not our game,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt play slowdown basketball.‚Äù But neither do the Warriors, and that is the issue.

GET TOUGH EARLY This is a suggestion that comes without a shred of actual strategic advice, but it would behoove the Cavaliers to avoid giving up a ton of points in the first 12 minutes of the game. In Game 1, the Warriors scored 35 points in the first quarter. In Game 2, they rang up 40. Phew! Golden State made clear that it wanted to play fast, and Cleveland let it happen. ‚ÄúI think the first quarter is really important,‚Äù Anthony said, adding that the Cavaliers had to send a message at the start that the Warriors could not score at will. Otherwise, he said, they would be ‚Äúallowing Golden State to have even more confidence.‚Äù TRISTAN? KYRIE? YOU THERE? Through the first two games, James is averaging 28.5 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists, while shooting 55.3 percent from the field. He has been loose with the ball at times ‚Äî eight turnovers in Game 1 ‚Äî but he is not the Cavaliers‚Äô problem. Nor is Kevin Love, who is averaging 21 points and 14 rebounds. It is their other teammates who have come up short ‚Äî in part, perhaps, because they are having trouble coping with the Warriors‚Äô pressure. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to find the next guy for Cleveland that you can say has played well,‚Äù said Fratello, who is now an analyst for NBA TV. Kyrie Irving, a major presence in last year‚Äôs finals, is not scaring anyone. J. R. Smith has scored a total of 3 points. Deron Williams has missed all nine of his field-goal attempts. Tristan Thompson, the Cleveland big man whom Anthony described as a ‚Äúcomplete nonfactor‚Äù in the finals, has grabbed all of eight rebounds in 44 combined minutes. Forget about the Warriors. This is not a winning formula for the Cavaliers against a lot of teams.  MEMORY HELPS In Game 3 of the finals a year ago ‚Äî June 8, to be exact ‚Äî the Cavaliers, down by two games to none, won by 30 points. Of course, they did lose Game 4 at home to the Warriors and might have been eliminated back in Oakland in Game 5 were it not for the fact that Golden State‚Äôs Draymond Green had to serve a one-game suspension for a flagrant foul. Advertisement That opened a door, and the Cavaliers took advantage and won the next three games and the championship. Last year‚Äôs Cavaliers team is basically this year‚Äôs Cavaliers team, so the players have not forgotten how they were able to rally. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where being an experienced team does help,‚Äù Anthony said. ‚ÄúIf this were an inexperienced team that hadn‚Äôt had a lot of postseason success, then I‚Äôd probably be in agreement that this series is basically over for Cleveland. Because psychologically, as an inexperienced team, you wouldn‚Äôt have anything to draw upon to tell you otherwise.‚Äù And the Cavaliers can also draw on James, who has been to seven straight finals, won some, lost some, and thus seems ready to deal with whatever fate has in store. ‚ÄúThere's nothing to be afraid of,‚Äù he said, adding that he spoke for himself. But now the Cavaliers have to speak as a group.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Keith Bradsher Trade pacts typically require years of detailed negotiations. The North American Free Trade Agreement needed two years. Creation of the World Trade Organization took eight. The Trump administration wants to remake global trade in a matter of months. To secure agreements quickly, the White House has taken a contentious approach to negotiations not seen in decades, threatening allies and adversaries alike with harsh sanctions like tariffs and quotas. Those tactics have returned a few early concessions from trading partners, including South Korea, whose revised trade agreement was formally announced by the United States on Wednesday. But it remains to be seen how much American workers would benefit from these deals and whether the global trading system can sustain the chaos. President Trump and his chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have set a series of crucial deadlines that are rapidly approaching. Temporary exemptions on imports of steel and aluminum from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Mexico and South Korea have been scheduled to expire on May 1, and the Trump administration has been using that deadline as a cudgel to extract concessions from those nations. Mr. Trump is demanding that Canada and Mexico, which have been locked in tense, monthslong negotiations with the United States over Nafta, agree to a rewrite of the trade pact in a matter of weeks. He is seeking Europe‚Äôs support by then in a trade showdown with China, and has publicly questioned whether the United States will continue to accept a deal made long ago that allows the European Union to charge a tariff on imported cars that is four times as high as the United States‚Äô tariff. In what might be the most difficult trade fight ahead, the Trump administration is taking steps to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion a year worth of goods from China as soon as late April. Behind the rapid pace is a political promise Mr. Trump made both as a candidate and as president that he would rip up global trade deals that did not work for the United States and rewrite them to favor domestic companies and workers. With the 2018 midterm elections fast approaching and many Republicans in vulnerable positions, Mr. Trump is trying to win agreements that will appeal to his base and help keep Republican control of Congress. If Mr. Trump‚Äôs push works, it could hasten the biggest rewrite of trade rules around the world since 118 nations agreed in Geneva in 1993 to create the World Trade Organization. But the rush carries significant risks. Hasty deals could do little to solve major, long-running problems for the United States, like China‚Äôs financial support for its homegrown companies. New tariffs could also prompt the United States‚Äô biggest trading partners to push back and ignite a trade war or a serious geopolitical confrontation. And it could simply prompt some nations to pull back from the United States, rather than accede to demands that may be unpalatable back home. ‚ÄúYou get this thing rolling and it gets hard to stop,‚Äù said Nelson G. Dong, an international investment and technology lawyer in the Seattle office of Dorsey & Whitney, a law firm. ‚ÄúEach side gets its manhood challenged.‚Äù There are legal risks as well. Trade pacts are usually inspected minutely by lawyers on both sides before they are signed. The United States is trying to conclude a rapid-fire series of them at a moment when the office of the United States trade representative is short-staffed for budgetary reasons. Many governments plan to challenge Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade actions at the World Trade Organization including Canada, which has already filed a sweeping trade case. For now, Mr. Trump‚Äôs highly ambitious agenda lacks even a clear schedule for trade ministers to meet and sort out the details. The approach has irritated trade ministers in Canada, China, the European Union and Mexico, who have made clear that they would prefer the United States address its chronic trade deficits in a quieter and more collegial manner. In the case of South Korea, the high-pressure tactic returned results ‚Äî though it is not yet clear how much Seoul‚Äôs concessions will help American workers. Under the deal announced on Wednesday, South Korea will reduce its steel exports to the United States by nearly one-third to avoid getting hit with new American steel tariffs. South Korea also agreed to double, to 50,000, the number of American cars that it will allow to be imported each year into the country without meeting South Korea‚Äôs unique safety standards, which have been criticized for decades by American and European officials as a trade barrier. South Korean demand for American cars appears to be growing, but the new rules may not provide an immediate increase for Detroit. According to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association, the number of cars imported from the United States remains below the 25,000 cap, reaching 20,019 last year. Still, the South Korea examples offers a look at what Mr. Trump may be seeking by pressuring trading partners for quick deals. Mr. Trump strongly hinted last week that his goal in confronting trading partners was a negotiated settlement, as opposed collecting billions of dollars from new tariffs. ‚ÄúI believe that, in many cases ‚Äî maybe all cases ‚Äî we‚Äôll end up negotiating a deal,‚Äù he said. It is not clear how well that approach will work with China, a much bigger and more pugnacious trading partner. Chinese officials have repeatedly said that they object to threats but do see room to reduce the country‚Äôs trade barriers. Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech this month that China was ready to lower tariffs on imported cars and some other items. ‚ÄúWe will make more efforts on market opening, promote industrial updating and the development of balanced trade, and provide more choices for consumers,‚Äù he said. Comments like that have some analysts predicting that a deal will be reached. ‚ÄúThe most likely outcome is that China will concede,‚Äù said Larry Hu, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Macquarie Securities. But significant risks remain of a possible trade war by the end of next month. ‚ÄúNafta could get some result by that date and the European Union might have a deal by then, but in the case of China, this will be more difficult,‚Äù said He Weiwen, a former Chinese Commerce Ministry official and longtime trade expert. ‚ÄúThe Chinese are very mad.‚Äù Already some in the Trump administration are spoiling for a fight over the W.T.O., which arbitrates international trade disputes. Mr. Lighthizer and many other Democratic and Republican trade experts have repeatedly complained that the W.T.O.‚Äôs process for reviewing and solving trade disputes has put the United States and Western countries at a disadvantage. Critics in the United States complain that the W.T.O. allows China to keep steep trade barriers: triple the average tariffs of the United States and double the average tariffs of the European Union. China‚Äôs retort is that the West agreed to the tariffs in the 1990s, and that a deal is a deal, not to be changed unless the West offers further concessions. Pascal Lamy, the former director general of the W.T.O., said that what the United States accomplishes could depend to a considerable extent on whether it seeks a broad opening up of international trade, including a requirement that China remove many trade barriers, or whether the United States ends up protecting its own market. ‚ÄúIf the United States carpet bombing on trade is about opening a negotiation, which is one of the interpretations, then I think there is ample room to improve the rules of the W.T.O.,‚Äù he said. But he added that if American officials ‚Äúare after blowing up the multilateral system, then it is a very serious issue.‚Äù Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.

Sports,"Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJUNE 9, 2017  The Golden State Warriors insisted all along that a 16-0 run in the playoffs was not their goal, that a championship was all that mattered. But after completing an improbable comeback to win Game 3 on Wednesday, they started to admit that they would like to finish things in Game 4. LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and the Cavaliers had other plans, putting on a record-setting offensive display in a 137-116 victory that will send the series back to Oakland, Calif., for a Game 5. Follow our live coverage of Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals here. ‚ñ† The Cavaliers were explosive right away, scoring an N.B.A. finals record 49 points in the first quarter. They went on to set N.B.A. records for points in a half (86) and for 3-pointers (24). ‚ñ† Irving led all scorers with 40 points, but James was still the catalyst for the Cavaliers, recording yet another triple-double with 31 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. Cleveland outscored Golden State by 32 points with James on the court but were just plus-7 in Irving‚Äôs 41 minutes. Advertisement ‚ñ† The Warriors had five players score in double figures, had 26 assists, and got 35 points from Kevin Durant, but it was not nearly enough on a night in which the team‚Äôs defense fell apart. They were leading all playoff teams this year in defensive efficiency coming into the game, but had no answer for Kevin Love, James or Irving. Advertisement ‚ñ† There were several arguments on the court, several hard fouls, a fan was ejected for arguing with the Golden State bench, and Dahntay Jones of the Cavaliers got a technical called against him without even entering the game. The referees even had to retroactively change a technical foul called against Draymond Green in the first half to avoid having to eject the star forward. When asked about the testiness after the game, Love laughed about it, saying ‚ÄúIt was bound to get scrappy eventually.‚Äù ‚ñ† Golden State had been trying to be the first N.B.A. team to complete a perfect postseason and, while that dream is officially over, they have a chance on Monday to be the first Bay Area sports team to clinch a championship at home since the Oakland Athletics did it in 1974. The Cavaliers have to travel to the Bay Area to do something no team has ever accomplished in an N.B.A. finals ‚Äî come back from a 3-0 deficit. ‚ÄúObviously we heard their comments saying that it would be satisfying to celebrate on our home floor,‚Äù Irving said. ‚ÄúHonestly, we were ready to get on this 2 p.m. flight tomorrow back to San Fran to get ready to play for Game 5.‚Äù Here‚Äôs a look at Game 4, as it happened: Game 4 was underway at 9:10 p.m. Eastern, with Cleveland winning the opening tip and starting things off with a 3-pointer by J.R. Smith that woke up a crowd that had been fairly quiet up to that point. With 9:22 remaining the Cavaliers are off to a red-hot start, with a 14-5 lead that is the largest lead in their favor all finals. Smith has two 3-pointers, LeBron James completed a difficult 3-point play after being fouled by Zaza Pachulia, and the Warriors seem a little stunned by the crispness of the Cleveland attack. A big change from the previous two games is Tristan Thompson appearing to be far more aggressive, with two rebounds including one on the offensive end which is his typical bread and butter. The Cavaliers have pushed the lead all the way to 27-11 with just under 7 minutes remaining in the quarter, looking like a team reborn on both ends of the court. They have been aggressively disrupting the Golden State offense and knocking down shots from all over the court when they have the ball. Advertisement There were plenty of people predicting the Cavaliers would simply fade away after the gut-punch of a loss that they received in Game 3, but they are completely controlling the game so far. Kevin Love is already up to 10 points and LeBron James already has 4 assists. The frustration was mounting for the Warriors, with the players and coaches arguing numerous calls from the officials and repeatedly ending plays shaking their heads as the fired-up Cavaliers were able to do anything they wanted on offense. But thanks to Kevin Durant, who scored 10 consecutive points for Golden State, and a dunk by Andre Iguodala, the lead had narrowed all the way to seven points 2:30 remaining in the quarter The Cavaliers have been a team possessed, but the question is if they can maintain a maximum level of effort for 48 minutes. They clearly ran out of gas in Game 3, leading to a painful loss, and are currently playing with an intensity far above where they were in that game. The Cavaliers appear to have no interest in being the ninth team to be swept out of the N.B.A. finals. In a 1st quarter in which everything went their way, the Cavs built an impressive 49-33 lead, with contributions coming from the entire team rather than just LeBron James. Their 49 points were the most in a quarter in N.B.A. finals history. Kevin Love leads Cleveland with 14 points and Kyrie Irving has 11, while James has been limited to 8 but has 6 assists and 4 rebounds. Even Richard Jefferson has been all over the place, drawing contact and finishing fast breaks. Defensively Cleveland was not perfect, letting Kevin Durant get to 10 points, but they have limited Golden State to just 6 assists and Stephen Curry has just 2 points. Advertisement Cleveland continues to get under Draymond Green‚Äôs skin, and they got a gift from him in the quarter when he hit Iman Shumpert in the neck while fighting for possession of a ball following a jump ball. It was his second personal foul, but he drew a technical foul for arguing. In a sideline interview, Coach Steve Kerr summed things up succinctly, saying ‚ÄúThey brought a lot of force and we weren‚Äôt ready for it.‚Äù If there was one thing that did not go right for the Cavaliers in the quarter it was in free-throw shooting, where they went just 14 for 22 (61.9 percent) from the line after having shot 81 percent in the first three games of the series. If the game ends up close later, the eight missed free-throws in the quarter will have seemed crucial. The opening of the second quarter has looked a lot like the first, with the Warriors not getting into any sort of rhythm offensively while the Cavaliers have continued to press. Ian Clark came up well short of the rim on a wide-open 3-pointer and Andre Iguodala simply threw the ball out of bounds on a pass that dramatically missed its mark. But in an excellent display of why Golden State is so frustrating to play, they have actually outscored Cleveland 9-5 in the first 3 minutes and 30 seconds of the quarter thanks to a series of difficult shots that managed to find a way through the hoop.

The luxury of having had the highest scoring quarter in N.B.A. finals history is that despite Golden State making up a little ground, Cleveland still has a 12-point lead. From a hard-to-comprehend 35-footer as the shot clock expired by J.R. Smith to an absolutely monstrous dunk from LeBron James, the second quarter has provided plenty of highlights for the Cleveland offense. With 5:38 remaining, they have built their lead to 20 points, with Kyrie Irving leading all scorers with 21 points. Perhaps the most unusual moment of the game, however, was a technical foul call on Dahntay Jones shortly after Smith‚Äôs long 3-pointer. The Cleveland benchwarmer was engaging in some words with Kevin Durant, but the call still seemed unusual since it involved someone unlikely to play in the game. As noted by ESPN‚Äôs Brian Windhorst, Jones will now have $9,000 in fines during the playoffs in a season where his salary was just $9,127. Golden State was expected by many to have a victory parade on Cleveland‚Äôs home court, but the Cavaliers hit them hard early in the game and the Warriors have yet to recover. At halftime, the Warriors were trailing, 86-68, and seemed helpless to put together any of their signature runs. Advertisement The Cavaliers, who set finals records for points in a quarter (49) and points in a half (86) are dishing out more assists and pulling down more rebounds than the Warriors, thanks in part to Tristan Thompson finally getting back to what he does best, giving his team 6 rebounds including 3 on the offensive end. Kyrie Irving has led all scorers with 28 points, but it has been a group effort on offense with LeBron James scoring 22, Kevin Love having 17 and J.R. Smith having 9. Golden State is still getting a ton of production from Kevin Durant, who scored 22, including a 3-pointer as the second quarter ended, but Stephen Curry has scored just 6. Curry has led all players in the playoffs in terms of plus/minus but is a minus-19 for the game. In the second half, the Warriors will need to get back to their flowing offensive style and will need Curry to find his scoring from the three previous games. But with the way James and Irving have played, how the Golden State offense plays the rest of the way might not matter. They will need to find a way to disrupt the Cavaliers stars or this series will go to Game 5. The Warriors opened the second half with four points in 45 seconds and Coach Tyronn Lue of the Cavaliers did not like what he saw and called an immediate timeout. The move proved prophetic as over the next three minutes of play, Cleveland outscored Golden State 10-5, hitting a few comical 3-pointers and regaining their momentum entirely. An extended argument between Kevin Durant and LeBron James at midcourt while a play was being reviewed showed that this series has far more emotion than anyone had given it credit for in the first three games. Durant was frustrated following a play in which Kevin Love made contact with his head on a layup attempt, and after a long review it was determined to be a flagrant foul. The referees may have been trying to ease the tension in a game that has gotten very chippy. But regardless of the officiating, the Cavaliers have their big lead thanks to an uncanny ability to erase any run by the Warriors. They‚Äôve done it with well-timed 3-pointers and tenacious defense. Advertisement James and Irving have had moments like this all series, but Love is potentially the biggest revelation of the game. He has been emulating the ‚ÄúMinnesota Kevin‚Äù that James regularly tries to goad him into becoming, and it has resulted in 23 points including 6 of 8 shooting form 3-point range. Draymond Green appeared to have been ejected after picking up his second technical foul for arguing with the officials. Green was frustrated by picking up his third personal foul on a rather meaningless play and he threw up his arms and yelled at the referee. He and his teammates, along with the ABC broadcast team, seemed shocked at the decision. But Green remained on the court and the explanation seems to be that the technical foul he received in the first half was on Steve Kerr and not Green, despite the stat sheets after the first half saying the first half technical was on Green. Doris Burke confirmed with the scorers‚Äô table that the officials told them in the first half that the technical foul was against Green, but after the second technical call against Green, they went over and told the scorers they had intended the call in the first half to go against Kerr. It appears they decided to make up for a quick whistle on the second technical by pretending the first one never happened. Things were testy throughout a tightly-contested third quarter, with several arguments on the court and even one between the Warriors‚Äô bench and some fans near them. The fan who argued was ejected from the game. In one particularly brutal exchange on the court, Zaza Pachulia fought for the ball with several Cavaliers players, with both he and Iman Shumpert exchanging some physical contact. On a replay, Shumpert seemed to be pushing down hard at Pachulia, who was on his back on the ground, and Pachulia may have kicked and punched at Shumpert‚Äôs groin. Both players received a technical after a long review. In terms of actual basketball, the Warriors outscored the Cavaliers for much of the quarter, but thanks to a 3-pointer by LeBron James in the closing seconds of the quarter, Cleveland increased the team‚Äôs lead to 19, having outscored the Warriors 29-28. Kevin Durant has been the biggest contributor in the Warriors‚Äô effort to get back into the game, scoring 31 points ‚Äî the fourth time he has topped 30 in this year‚Äôs finals ‚Äî but there has been no slowdown from the Cleveland offense as of yet. Make no mistake, Cleveland is still clearly in the driver‚Äôs seat, with their Big Three combining for 94 points and 14 assists. But considering how well Golden State can play when they start getting some momentum, this game is not over. LeBron James opened up the fourth quarter on the bench, and Golden State‚Äôs rookie guard Patrick McCaw opened up the scoring for Golden State with a wide open 3-pointer. Klay Thompson hit a 3-pointer on the next possession, creating a 6-0 run, and Coach Tyronn Lue of the Cavaliers repeated the trick that worked so well for him in the third quarter by calling a timeout after just 1:05 of play. Advertisement Coming out of the timeout, Lue left James on the bench, but after Kyle Korver turned the ball over by stepping out of bounds, that was enough for Lueto bring James back out. His total rest was 1 minute and 38 seconds. Golden State may have the reputation for loving 3-pointers, but Cleveland hit nearly 100 more of them during the regular season. The Cavaliers‚Äô proficiency with that shot has been huge in this game, shooting 21 for 36 as a team while the Warriors have gone just 10 for 32, with Stephen Curry hitting just 2 of 8. As the midpoint of the fourth quarter nears, the Warriors are down by 17 points and have not had a lead at any point during the game, making their dreams of a perfect postseason almost out of their reach.

Sports,"Advertisement By MARC STEINOCT. 16, 2017  No matter how incongruous it might look to an outsider to see a former point guard extraordinaire tutoring one of the most distinctive lanky forwards in the history of the sport, there is zero hesitation from Steve Nash. Nash aggressively challenges Golden State‚Äôs Kevin Durant on building core strength and improving his balance, forces him into the most extreme of squats to increase his mobility and stability, quizzes him on pick-and-roll decision making, goads him into aiming for even greater efficiency than Durant already delivers and, as seen at one session I‚Äôll never forget, asks him to shoot extra free throws because he spots something askew mechanically. Nash felt he had to address it, apparently, even though Durant, the reigning N.B.A. Finals M.V.P., is a career 88.2 percent shooter at the free-throw line. ‚ÄúInstead of looking at the huge, obvious differences between us, I think there are a lot of similarities in our games,‚Äù Nash, an eight-time All-Star, said of Durant. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot I can share with him even though it might look to you like an unlikely pairing. He handles the ball in the pick and roll, he‚Äôs a terrific passer, he‚Äôs so good at attacking with the ball. Advertisement ‚ÄúIf I can teach him some of the things I did to create space and get shots off and make my teammates better at 6-2, it can only help him at his height.‚Äù Durant, in return, refers to Nash as ‚Äúmy Yoda,‚Äù as we learned via the ‚ÄúStill KD‚Äù documentary released in July. Nash typically spends only a few days a month with the Warriors in his role as a player development consultant, but he‚Äôs as close to Durant as anyone in the organization. They were introduced late in Nash‚Äôs playing career by the Brooklyn Nets assistant Adam Harrington ‚Äî one of Nash‚Äôs former teammates in Dallas ‚Äî and started building a friendship long before Durant made the polarizing (and landscape-changing) decision to leave Oklahoma City for the Bay Area in July 2016. Golden State‚Äôs coach, Steve Kerr, and Kerr‚Äôs assistant Bruce Fraser are two more of Nash‚Äôs closest friends, which helps feed into what Nash, a two-time most valuable player, describes as an ‚Äúintimate understanding‚Äù of how the N.B.A.‚Äôs reigning champions and prohibitive 2018 title favorites operate, no matter how rarely he actually shares their company. Feel was always a Nash specialty, knowing precisely where to probe the defense or where his passing targets wanted the ball. So when he tells you that he knows where he belongs in the Warriors‚Äô world and where he doesn‚Äôt, you buy in immediately. Advertisement It is Nash‚Äôs contention, along these lines, that he shouldn‚Äôt be featured as part of Golden State‚Äôs ring and banner ceremony on Tuesday night before their season opener at home against the Houston Rockets. The Warriors‚Äô general manager, Bob Myers, and their relentless vice president of communications, Raymond Ridder, made it clear to Nash, 43, in recent days that he would indeed be receiving the championship ring that eluded him as a player. So, naturally, they wanted him to join Durant, Stephen Curry and the rest of the squad for the televised festivities before tipoff. As of Monday evening, Nash was holding firm on his determination to decline. ‚ÄúThis is their moment,‚Äù Nash said in a phone interview. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be happier to be part of a championship team and, more importantly, this championship culture. ‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôve played 18 years in the N.B.A. and you win it all as a consultant, it doesn‚Äôt feel right to do anything but stay in the background. I don‚Äôt want to disrespect anything or upset anyone, but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my place to be there.‚Äù Kerr understands. He‚Äôs not surprised by Nash‚Äôs stance and isn‚Äôt trying to talk him out of it. He insists that Nash, whose later years in Phoenix became synonymous with playoff heartbreak, is far from haunted by his lack of championship jewelry, even if basketball stars, maybe more than anyone else in the team-sports realm, are judged almost exclusively on titles won. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Steve, for one second, looks back on his career and thinks, ‚ÄòOh, my God, I didn‚Äôt win a ring,‚Äô ‚Äù said Kerr, who won five in his playing days as an off-the-bench contributor in Chicago and San Antonio. ‚ÄúHe has such great work-life balance. John Stockton‚Äôs the same. Charles Barkley‚Äôs the same. Is there any happier guy out there than Barkley? You can tell he‚Äôs having so much fun on TV.‚Äù Kerr added: ‚ÄúI think fans and the media kind of overrate that whole ring thing. I would trade my career for Nash‚Äôs in a heartbeat. Would I want to be a role player on championship teams or be a superstar like Steve was and dominate games and seasons?‚Äù In his post-playing life, Nash is a busy father of four in Los Angeles who also serves as the general manager for the men‚Äôs senior national team in his native Canada. What‚Äôs left of his time, away from family and business interests, is reserved for Durant or any other Warriors player who feels they can benefit from his counsel, as well as providing unfiltered feedback on the team to Kerr from what they like to call ‚Äúthe 30,000-foot view.‚Äù ‚ÄúI actually like that he‚Äôs not here every day,‚Äù Kerr said. ‚ÄúSometimes as a staff we fall into groupthink. Steve will usually tell me something I haven‚Äôt thought of. Advertisement ‚ÄúThe other thing is that Steve can go to Kevin or Steph and talk to them as a former superstar who‚Äôs been in their shoes. I can‚Äôt do that. He was a two-time M.V.P. He‚Äôs literally lived their life. I didn‚Äôt live their life as a player; I lived Ian Clark‚Äôs life.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Clark, now in New Orleans after two seasons as an underrated backcourt wild card in the Warriors‚Äô rotation, will have to wait to collect his ring until late November, when the Pelicans visit Oracle Arena. About 25 members of the Golden State organization, including front-office staffers and coaches, are scheduled as part of Tuesday‚Äôs program. The first-time ring winners, as always, will likely generate the most curiosity over their reactions. We‚Äôre talking JaVale McGee, Zaza Pachulia and David West. And, of course, Durant, whose decision to team up with three fellow All-Stars in Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson brought him mostly scorn ‚Äî until he rose above every ace on both sides, including LeBron James, in Golden State‚Äôs five-game demolition of the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals. ‚ÄúHe took a lot of heat for his decision, so it hasn‚Äôt always been easy, but he was at his best when it counted most and I think he‚Äôs handled it all on the court incredibly well,‚Äù Nash said of Durant. ‚ÄúHe made a life choice to go somewhere else and put himself in a new environment and challenge himself. It‚Äôs been fantastic for him as a man and winning a championship on top of it was the fruit of that decision.‚Äù Asked to project what the coming season holds for the 29-year-old Durant after his title breakthrough, Nash used a word more typically reserved these days for Milwaukee‚Äôs Giannis Antetokounmpo or the Knicks‚Äô Kristaps Porzingis. ‚ÄúWe talk about some of these young players being unicorns,‚Äù Nash said. ‚ÄúWhat Kevin can do at his size, with his athleticism, with his skill set, with his agility ‚Äî he‚Äôs a true unicorn.‚Äù A unicorn who will soon be sporting gaudy bling from a Beverly Hills jeweler.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by Businesses previously focused on making fitness apparel, cigars and beverages have rebranded themselves into virtual currency or blockchain companies. By Nathaniel Popper It‚Äôs clear that a business idea is hot when companies that have nothing to do with the idea get involved. It‚Äôs clear that the idea has turned into a mania when investors reward companies for doing this.  And that‚Äôs exactly the case these days with Bitcoin and all of its ancillary concepts, including the blockchain, the ledger on which virtual currency transactions are recorded.  As the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed in recent months, companies previously focused on making fitness apparel, cigars and beverages, among other things, have rebranded themselves as virtual currency or blockchain companies of one sort or another. And investors have cheered them on, pushing their stock prices up.  Here‚Äôs a look at some of the rebranded companies and their explanations. BEFORE AFTER Long Island Iced Tea made iced teas in flavors including peach and lemon, as well as lemonades. On Thursday, the company, based in Farmingdale, N.Y., said it was shifting its corporate focus to the blockchain. The company said: ‚ÄúWe view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry.‚Äù (December 21)   BEFORE AFTER Vapetek made batteries and liquid for electronic cigarettes. In September, it rolled out a candy flavored e-liquid called Rock Kandi. This month, the Nevada-based company renamed itself and said it would shift to mining virtual currencies.  In the company‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúWe are confident that cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology has a large market opportunity in the coming years and we look forward to growing the company and creating shareholder value, while helping to innovate the future of global currency.‚Äù (December 20)  BEFORE AFTER Bioptix was a pharmaceutical company until this year. In October, the Colorado company said it was changing its name, making an investment in a Canadian virtual currency exchange and creating operations to mine Bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  The company said that alongside its virtual currency business, it will continue to pursue ‚Äúproducts for cattle, equine and swine for the assistance and facilitation of reproduction.‚Äù (October 4)  BEFORE AFTER To become a public company, The Crypto Company acquired a small existing public company, Croe, which previously developed women‚Äôs fitness clothing.  The company said this summer that its ‚Äúcore services include consulting and advising companies regarding investment and trading in the digital asset market and investing in a manner that diversifies exposure to the growing class of digital assets.‚Äù (June 9) After the change, the Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned by the company‚Äôs actions, suspended trading of its stock.   BEFORE AFTER On-Line was a small British company that previously incubated internet businesses. This fall, the company said it was renaming itself and shifting to focus on virtual currency technology.  The company said: ‚ÄúBlockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are a new and exciting area we have been working on for some time to provide systems to support the roll out of these technologies across a range of applications.‚Äù (October 26)  BEFORE AFTER Rich Cigars previously produced cigars. But the Florida company said this month that it was changing its name, getting out of the cigar business, moving to Colorado and creating subsidiaries to mine for virtual currencies.  The company said it will be pursuing ‚Äúthe development of a unique cryptocurrency mining business for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which will operate on a 24/7 basis.‚Äù (December 14) BEFORE AFTER 360 Capital Financial provided financial services to companies. In October, the Canadian company announced it would change its name and ticker symbol and begin investing exclusively in blockchain-based companies. The company said: ‚ÄúWe are taking an all-round view to the 360 Blockchain Inc. business plan; with a mission to empower blockchain technologies with capital and experience to create exponential value.‚Äù (October 4) BEFORE AFTER Leeta Gold was focused on mineral exploration in Canada, though with little apparent success. This summer, the company said it was acquiring a Bitcoin mining company, Genesis, with facilities in Iceland and renaming itself.  According to the company: ‚ÄúThis transaction positions HIVE as a leading cryptocurrency miner in an attractive jurisdiction, Iceland, with low energy costs.‚Äù (June 14) Nathaniel Popper covers finance and technology.

Technology,"Advertisement By NATHANIEL POPPERAPRIL 29, 2018  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles. Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B. They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards. ‚ÄúLook, the internet belongs to the Americans ‚Äî but blockchain will belong to us,‚Äù he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country‚Äôs four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B. Advertisement Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: ‚ÄúThe internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians.‚Äù Advertisement Both of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment. The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain ‚Äî a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting ‚Äî and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles. The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack. The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more. Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants. ‚ÄúIt is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,‚Äù said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. ‚ÄúTo get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically.‚Äù The original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data. There are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations ‚Äî and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Advertisement But in countries like the United States, China, Russia, Singapore and Switzerland, government groups have talked about using blockchains for myriad tasks, like issuing national currency or tracking identity records for citizens and visitors. Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes. Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity. ‚ÄúIn the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,‚Äù said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. ‚ÄúIf something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale ‚Äî and won‚Äôt be questioned on the way in.‚Äù Ms. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries. The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting ‚Äî first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations. ‚ÄúThere has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward,‚Äù said Mr. Dunn, who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committee. Advertisement Few countries have made their interest in the blockchain as clear as Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin met briefly last year with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the second most widely used blockchain-based virtual currency platform after Bitcoin. Mr. Putin also put the blockchain at the center of his ‚ÄúDigital Economy‚Äù program for Russia, and his government has talked about creating a crypto-ruble, similar to Bitcoin. One of the Russian delegates to the I.S.O. blockchain group, Maxim Shevchenko, gave a talk last summer in Russia in which he spoke about the country‚Äôs goals in the I.S.O. group. The bullet points on the slide included ‚Äúpossibility to influence the technology‚Äù and ‚Äúimplementation Russian standards and solutions worldwide.‚Äù Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B. Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains. At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants. The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology. At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France. Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology. Advertisement ‚ÄúIt will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.‚Äù Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson WASHINGTON ‚Äî With trade tensions mounting between the United States and China, President Trump said he would dispatch his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and other top economic advisers to Beijing next week to try to forestall an all-out trade war. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was optimistic that the United States could reach a deal with China. But he warned that if the Asian nation did not live up to its promises to open its markets, his administration would proceed with the tariffs he has threatened to impose on as much as $150 billion worth of Chinese products. ‚ÄúI think China is very serious, and we‚Äôre very serious,‚Äù Mr. Trump said between meetings with President Emmanuel Macron of France. ‚ÄúWe have no choice but to be very serious.‚Äù Mr. Trump said that the United States delegation was making the trip at China‚Äôs request and that he was heartened by recent remarks by its president, Xi Jinping, suggesting that he was prepared to open his country‚Äôs economy to more foreign investment and ease restrictions on imports of American cars. The two economic giants have been locked in a tit-for-tat battle over tariffs, with the United States threatening to tax Chinese products like TVs and medical devices and the Chinese retaliating with tariffs on pork and threatening to impose additional penalties on soybeans and other American goods. Mr. Mnuchin is expected to be joined on the trip by Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House‚Äôs National Economic Council, and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. The delegation comprises a wide range of views on trade, with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Kudlow, a former CNBC economic commentator, more receptive to free trade and resistant to draconian tariffs, and Mr. Lighthizer encouraging the president to take a harder line. Peter Navarro, a trade adviser and the author of the book ‚ÄúDeath by China,‚Äù may also travel with the group, but an administration official said the details were not yet finalized. Chinese officials have increasingly turned to Mr. Mnuchin as their primary contact in trade talks, which some observers say may stem from China‚Äôs perception that he is more sensitive to their concerns. After the formal ‚Äúeconomic dialogue‚Äù between the United States and China stalled last summer, Mr. Mnuchin has held regular discussions with his Chinese counterparts, including Liu He, China‚Äôs new economic minister. The Chinese view Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Kudlow, who both previously worked on Wall Street, as potentially more moderate voices who would be more reluctant to start a trade conflict that could damage American businesses and cause stock markets to plunge. They hope the two men will be more sympathetic to offers to open up China‚Äôs financial market and reduce its trade surplus by making purchases of American natural gas and other products, people briefed on the deliberations said. Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer, meanwhile, have criticized China‚Äôs offerings and insisted that the Chinese make more sweeping changes to its economy, including removing industrial subsidies and rolling back government intervention in the economy. The stakes of the trip are high after months of increasing strain between China and the United States. Fears about a trade war between the world‚Äôs two biggest economic powers emerged in March after Mr. Trump unveiled tariffs on global imports of aluminum and steel. The threat of tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports followed. Next month, the Treasury Department is expected to release a plan to further restrict Chinese investment in American companies, including industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence that are sensitive for national security reasons. The rules could also restrict American partnerships with Chinese companies abroad. China has not taken such threats lightly. In recent weeks it has hit back with its own threats, raising concerns among farmers and businesses in the United States that the escalating dispute could be a drag on the economy and blunt the effect of the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law in December. But Mr. Xi has also signaled that he is open to negotiating with Mr. Trump. He said this month that China would reduce its tariffs on autos, which Mr. Mnuchin called ‚Äúa big step in the right direction.‚Äù While some trade experts warned that China has failed to deliver on such promises before, Mr. Trump insisted on Tuesday that he was encouraged about the possibility of a deal. ‚ÄúPresident Xi made a speech four days ago where he said that China is going to be opened up,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not opened up right now. They trade with us. We can‚Äôt trade with them.‚Äù Some China analysts were not so impressed by Mr. Xi‚Äôs speech. ‚ÄúI thought it was a bunch of warmed-over repetition of things we had heard before,‚Äù said Scott Kennedy, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ‚ÄúFor me, the concern is that the level of mixed messaging that we‚Äôre sending the Chinese makes them expect that they can get through this with a very limited offer.‚Äù Edward Mills, a public policy analyst at Raymond James Financial, said he still viewed negotiations that averted tariffs as the most likely outcome. That could include, for example, China promising to reduce tariffs on American cars, open up its financial sector and drop rules that require American companies to partner with Chinese firms in many industries. But the negotiations could drag out for months, damaging business relations. Mr. Trump ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt actually identified what he wants as the end game‚Äù of the negotiations, Mr. Mills said. ‚ÄúI think that is something that gives a lot of flexibility to Mnuchin and the president to declare a number of things as a victory.‚Äù Some veterans of trade talks with China caution that Mr. Trump‚Äôs approach could backfire. ‚ÄúI think that it‚Äôs very dangerous to get into a tit-for-tat war in trade, because even if your goal is to be moderate and proportional in response, one thing can lead to another and it can get out of control,‚Äù Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, told CNBC last week. However, Paul H. O‚ÄôNeill, who was President George W. Bush‚Äôs first Treasury secretary and traveled to China for talks in 2001, said it was a good sign that the American delegation was making the trip. Negotiations with Chinese officials tend to be well choreographed, he said, so it is likely that the dimensions of a trade agreement are starting to take shape. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs already been endless conversations, and tweets, from our side,‚Äù Mr. O‚ÄôNeill said in an interview. ‚ÄúThey are shadow dancing with each other, but behind the scenes where we can‚Äôt see what is going on, apparently they are making some progress.‚Äù   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Editorial By The Editorial Board The former C.I.A. director John Brennan pulled no punches on Wednesday when he was asked why President Trump had congratulated his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for his victory in a rigged election, even after Mr. Trump‚Äôs national security staff warned him not to. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs afraid of the president of Russia,‚Äù Mr. Brennan said, on MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù program, of the phone call on Tuesday between the two presidents. ‚ÄúThe Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump and may have things they could expose.‚Äù The possibility that Mr. Putin could have some hold on the American president has lurked in the background over the past year as Mr. Trump displayed a mystifying affection for the Russian leader and ignored or excused his aggressive behavior and nefarious activities, most important, his interference in the 2016 campaign, a subject of the special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation. Some Trump defenders noted that President Barack Obama also called Mr. Putin when he was elected president in 2012. But the circumstances are very different. In the intervening years, Mr. Putin has become an increasingly authoritarian leader who has crushed most of his political opposition and engineered a deeply lopsided re-election this week. American intelligence officials say they are certain that he meddled in the 2016 American election on behalf of Mr. Trump and is trying to meddle again in the 2018 election, as well as in many European elections. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, is waging war in other parts of Ukraine and is enabling President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. While the administration recently imposed its first significant sanctions on Russia for election interference and other malicious cyberattacks and has faulted Russia for the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain, Mr. Trump has refrained from criticizing Mr. Putin or calling him to account. The phone call reinforced that approach. What Mr. Trump didn‚Äôt say to Mr. Putin was as significant as what he did say. He did not demand that Mr. Putin stop meddling in American elections or others, he did not even raise Moscow‚Äôs role in the poisoning. He made no mention of the unfair political system that deprives Russians of a real say in their government. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, later reinforced Mr. Trump‚Äôs lack of interest, telling reporters it was not America‚Äôs place to question how other countries conduct their elections. The disparity between Mr. Trump and his advisers, who seem to take threats from Russia more seriously, is becoming more pronounced. A senior administration official told The Times that Mr. Trump didn‚Äôt want to antagonize Mr. Putin because fostering rapport is the only way to improve relations between the two countries. On Tuesday, the president said he hoped to meet Mr. Putin soon and discuss preventing an arms race ‚Äî an arms race both leaders have encouraged with loose talk and investment in new weapons. Engaging Russia and preventing an arms race are undeniably important. But it‚Äôs hard to see how praising and appeasing a bully will advance American interests. That‚Äôs not the approach Mr. Trump has taken with adversaries like North Korea or Iran, or, for that matter, even with some allies. While Mr. Trump panders to Mr. Putin, his criticism of Mr. Mueller is becoming harsher, as the investigation raises increasingly serious concerns about a web of ties connecting Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates to Russia. Mr. Trump‚Äôs former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with Russia. A former foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with Russians. A former deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, who had his own Russian connections along with a now-indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has pleaded guilty to lying about Russian-related matters. Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed Mr. Trump‚Äôs company for any documents involving Russia. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee say Mr. Trump was ‚Äúactively negotiating a business deal in Moscow with a sanctioned Russian bank‚Äù during the 2016 campaign season. And Mr. Mueller has charged 13 Russians with conspiring to subvert the 2016 election and put Mr. Trump in the White House. Mr. Brennan‚Äôs fears clearly arise from some of these elements. Mr. Brennan knows more than most about possible threats to America, but he is not the only one speaking out. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, slammed Mr. Trump, saying ‚Äúan American president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections.‚Äù Even the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who rarely crosses Mr. Trump, said calling Mr. Putin ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt have been high on my list.‚Äù If Mr. Trump isn‚Äôt Mr. Putin‚Äôs lackey, it‚Äôs past time for him to prove it.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Andrew E. Kramer and Sharon LaFraniere MOSCOW ‚Äî The Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower in June 2016 on the premise that she would deliver damaging information about Hillary Clinton has long insisted she is a private attorney, not a Kremlin operative trying to meddle in the presidential election. But newly released emails show that in at least one instance two years earlier, the lawyer, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, worked hand in glove with Russia‚Äôs chief legal office to thwart a Justice Department civil fraud case against a well-connected Russian firm. Ms. Veselnitskaya also appears to have recanted her earlier denials of Russian government ties. During an interview to be broadcast Friday by NBC News, she acknowledged that she was not merely a private lawyer but a source of information for a top Kremlin official, Yuri Y. Chaika, the prosecutor general. ‚ÄúI am a lawyer, and I am an informant,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSince 2013, I have been actively communicating with the office of the Russian prosecutor general.‚Äù The previously undisclosed details about Ms. Veselnitskaya rekindle questions about who she was representing when she met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and others at Trump Tower in Manhattan during the campaign. The meeting, one focus of the special counsel investigation into Russia‚Äôs election interference, was organized after an intermediary promised that Ms. Veselnitskaya would deliver documents that would incriminate Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Veselnitskaya had long insisted that she met the president‚Äôs son, son-in-law and campaign chairman in a private capacity, not as a representative of the Russian government. ‚ÄúI operate independently of any governmental bodies,‚Äù she wrote in a November statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee. ‚ÄúI have no relationship with Mr. Chaika, his representatives and his institutions other than those related to my professional functions as a lawyer.‚Äù But that claim had already been undercut last fall by revelations that her talking points for the Trump Tower meeting ‚Äî detailing tax and financial fraud accusations against two Democratic Party donors tied to a Kremlin opponent ‚Äî matched those in a confidential memorandum circulated by Mr. Chaika‚Äôs office. And a sheaf of Ms. Veselnitskaya‚Äôs email correspondence released Friday appeared to show that her relationship with Mr. Chaika‚Äôs office is far closer than she has described. The emails were obtained by Dossier, an organization set up by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, a former tycoon who was stripped of his oil holdings, imprisoned and then exiled from his native Russia. He has emerged as a leading opponent of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Shown copies of the emails by Richard Engel of NBC News, Ms. Veselnitskaya acknowledged that ‚Äúmany things included here are from my documents, my personal documents.‚Äù She told the Russian news agency Interfax on Wednesday that her email accounts were hacked this year by people determined to discredit her, and that she would report the hack to Russian authorities. The Russian prosecutor general‚Äôs office did not respond to requests for comment. In an email, Ms. Veselnitskaya said she would respond in two weeks. A Russian lawyer who met with members of the Trump campaign in June 2016 admitted to acting as an informant to a top Kremlin official. The exchanges document Mr. Chaika‚Äôs response to a Justice Department request in 2014 for help with its civil fraud case against a real estate firm, Prevezon Holdings Ltd., and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv, a well-connected Russian businessman. Federal prosecutors say Ms. Veselnitskaya was the driving force on Mr. Katsyv‚Äôs defense team, a description she has echoed in court filings. In a declaration to the court, she identified herself as a lawyer in private practice, representing Mr. Katsyv and his firm. The Justice Department prosecutors charged Mr. Katsyv‚Äôs firm in 2013 with using real estate purchases in New York to launder a portion of the profits from a tax scheme in Russia. They were seeking Russian bank, tax and court records, the type of documents that typically form the crux of civil money-laundering cases. The Justice Department asked the Russian government to keep the matter confidential, ‚Äúexcept as is necessary to execute this request,‚Äù according to court documents. Russia and the United States have a mutual legal assistance treaty governing law-enforcement requests. The emails indicate that a senior prosecutor on Mr. Chaika‚Äôs staff, Sergei A. Bochkaryov, worked closely with Ms. Veselnitskaya to craft the Russian government response. She knew him well enough to address him in friendly terms. ‚ÄúDear Sergei Aleksandrovich!‚Äù Ms. Veselnitskaya wrote on Aug. 2, 2014, in one of at least 11 emails exchanged. ‚ÄúI am sending you the edits in the draft response, as per instructions. I am ready to answer any questions that arise, at any time convenient for you.‚Äù The language in their final email exchange matches that of the prosecutor general‚Äôs official response to the Justice Department. The judge in the case later wrote that the Russian government had ‚Äúspurned‚Äù the Justice Department‚Äôs request for evidence, instead sending a lengthy treatise on why Ms. Veselnitskaya‚Äôs client was innocent. Ms. Veselnitskaya‚Äôs involvement in the official communications with the Russian government ‚Äúraises serious questions about obstruction of justice and false statements,‚Äù said Jaimie Nawaday, a former assistant United States attorney in Manhattan who was a prosecutor on the case. She said Ms. Veselnitskaya‚Äôs actions should be referred to the United States attorney‚Äôs office for investigation, including whether she misrepresented herself to the court. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely outrageous,‚Äù Ms. Nawaday said. Asked about the Russian government‚Äôs culpability, Andrew Keane Woods, a professor at the University of Kentucky law school who specializes in international law, said, ‚ÄúIf there was funny business, then they are not really complying with the terms of the treaty.‚Äù But, he added, ‚Äúthere is no clear sanction‚Äù for failing to comply. Moscow‚Äôs refusal to provide records to the American prosecutors dealt a severe blow to the case. In the end, the Justice Department agreed to settle it for about $6 million. Prevezon did not admit fault. Although Ms. Veselnitskaya appears to have influenced how the Russian prosecutor general‚Äôs office justified its decision, its refusal to cooperate was not unexpected. The tax fraud was uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who was imprisoned and died in custody after disclosing the theft. Russian officials contend that the Magnitsky case, which became a cause c√©l√®bre in Washington, was a fraud concocted by the West to justify sanctions against Russian citizens. The release of Ms. Veselnitskaya‚Äôs emails by Mr. Khodorkovsky marks a second foray by Russian opposition figures into the controversy over Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. In a telephone interview, Mr. Khodorkovsky said someone had deposited the email records anonymously into an electronic drop box maintained by his organization. This year, Aleksei A. Navalny, a key opposition leader in Russia, also publicized videos that he said hinted at a role for Oleg V. Deripaska, a well-known Russian oligarch, in the Russian government‚Äôs efforts to meddle in the American political process. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska said Mr. Navalny‚Äôs accusations were utterly false. Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow, and Sharon LaFraniere from Washington. Follow Andrew E.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Mark Landler and Alan Rappeport WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump on Thursday plans to announce at least $50 billion worth of annual tariffs and other penalties on China for its theft of technology and trade secrets, which administration officials say has robbed American companies of billions of dollars in revenue and killed thousands of jobs. The measures would mark Mr. Trump‚Äôs most aggressive move yet against a fast-rising economic rival that he has accused of preying on the United States. The measures will be targeted at imported Chinese goods in as many as 100 categories ‚Äî hitting everything from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics ‚Äî and will impose restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, people briefed on the measures said. Mr. Trump will instruct the Treasury Department to pursue restrictions on certain types of Chinese investments to counter China‚Äôs ambitious industrial policy, which aims to dominate cutting-edge sectors like artificial intelligence and mobile technology, officials said. For Mr. Trump, the steps fulfill a frequent campaign pledge to crack down on China, which he has characterized as an ‚Äúeconomic enemy‚Äù that has ‚Äútaken advantage of us like nobody in history.‚Äù But the actions will only ratchet up tensions with the Chinese government at a moment when Mr. Trump needs its support for his campaign to curb North Korea‚Äôs nuclear program. The announcement comes hard on the heels of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which are scheduled to go into effect on Friday and are aimed at combating a flood of cheap metals into the United States, including Chinese steel. Taken together, Mr. Trump‚Äôs actions demonstrate his resolve to turn away from a decades-long move toward open markets and integrated world economies and toward a more starkly protectionist approach that erects barriers around a Fortress America. The moves risk further isolating the United States at a delicate geopolitical moment by inflaming key allies, as well as China. China has long argued that both sides benefit from the flow of Chinese money into the United States. At a daily news briefing on Wednesday, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry, reiterated that the country does not want a trade war and that the economic ties between the two countries have lowered costs for American consumers. Ms. Hua added that China would be ready to retaliate, without providing details. ‚ÄúIf the day did come when the U.S. took measures to hurt our interests, we will definitely take firm and necessary countermeasures to safeguard our legitimate interests,‚Äù she said. The effect of the China tariffs would be larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures and would have a bigger impact on United States consumers, who are heavy purchasers of electronics, clothing and other Chinese imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs would affect imports of roughly $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The China moves would affect at least $50 billion a year in imports, officials said. Chinese companies have also been placing big bets on American companies. New Chinese acquisition deals in the United States once totaled tens of billions of dollars annually, according to Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad, though last year they fell sharply to $8.7 billion as China cracked down on money leaving its borders. Chinese companies have purchased many nonstrategic assets like movie theaters and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. But they also sought out deals in cutting-edge areas like semiconductors and start-ups related to autonomous driving as China looked to upgrade its technological capabilities. China sees the American stranglehold on fundamental technologies as a long-term economic and security threat to its rise as a superpower. Unlike the metal tariffs, which caused bitter divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and businesspeople, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries. ‚ÄúTheir theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,‚Äù said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration. The business community, which long defended trade with China despite accusations of theft of intellectual property, has grown more dissatisfied with adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has steadily deteriorated. Still, American business groups expressed concern over the possibility that the United States tariffs would spur others around the world to raise their own trade barriers. ‚ÄúA focused effort to fix the problems is better than imposing sanctions that will bring collateral damage to American households, farmers and manufacturers,‚Äù Jake Parker, vice president of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council, said in an emailed statement. The country, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, has sought to build up businesses it considers critical for defending its national security interests and meeting its economic goals. Beijing has been enlisting American companies in its effort. As it looks to create its own national champions, China has been forcing American stalwarts like Qualcomm, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to create joint ventures, hand over their technology or develop local expertise. If they do not, companies risk losing access to China, the world‚Äôs second-largest economy. But China‚Äôs national security interests are colliding with those of the United States. A worry is that companies are handing over critical technology that the United States needs for its military, defense or infrastructure. By transferring technology, they may also be giving an edge to Chinese rivals that one day may prove dominant. This month, the United States government blocked Broadcom‚Äôs hostile bid for Qualcomm, a chip maker, citing national security concerns. The fear was that the acquisition would weaken Qualcomm, allowing China an advantage in the race to build the next generation of wireless technology. Last August, Mr. Trump ordered an investigation into four types of Chinese trade practices, including requiring companies to share trade secrets to gain access to the Chinese market, forcing them to license their technology in China at below-market rates and cyberintrusions to steal technology. China also uses state funds to buy American high-tech companies. On Wednesday, a senior official at the United States trade representative‚Äôs office said the investigation, which is now complete, found ample evidence of abuses in all these areas. The official said China had not changed its behavior, despite years of negotiations in the World Trade Organization and economic dialogues with the last three administrations. If anything, the administration said, its failure to honor the obligations it made when it joined the World Trade Organization has gotten worse. China‚Äôs theft of intellectual property, officials said, contributed to its trade surplus of $375.2 billion with the United States last year. China has also introduced a plan to gain global leadership in advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace, among other industries. Mr. Trump is expected to ask the United States trade representative to come up with a full list of products to retaliate against within 15 days, according to an official briefed on the plans. Experts worry that the United States‚Äô actions could ignite a trade war, noting that Chinese economic officials have a keen understanding of the American system and are good at designing targeted retaliatory measures against American agricultural products and other exports. Mr. Trump‚Äôs moves will also test the personal relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Xi, the Chinese president. Last year, Mr. Trump held off imposing tough trade measures against China because, he said, Mr. Xi was cooperating in his campaign to pressure the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump agreed to meet Mr. Kim for talks, surprising Mr. Xi, whom he did not consult before making the decision. Now, Mr. Trump will be seeking the Chinese president‚Äôs support for his diplomacy at the same time that trade tensions between are on the rise. Still, given their deep frustration, business executives may greet Mr. Trump‚Äôs move with quiet satisfaction. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs now palpable frustration across a number of sectors of the American business community feeling increasingly squeezed by an ever-more-emboldened China,‚Äù said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. ‚ÄúWhile some are eager to continue seeking as much engagement with China as possible, others are openly using terms and invoking options they hadn‚Äôt previously considered.‚Äù The United States‚Äô chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, who testified before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China. ‚ÄúThere are certain technology products that are under assault,‚Äù Mr. Lighthizer said. ‚ÄúYou have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products.‚Äù But he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. ‚ÄúYou would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,‚Äù he said. Mr. Lighthizer‚Äôs testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that ‚Äútrade wars are good, and easy to win.‚Äù But Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. ‚ÄúNobody wins from a trade war,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe certainly don‚Äôt want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 ‚Äî and growing ‚Äî billion trade deficit?‚Äù Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Alan Rappeport from Santiago, Chile.

Business,"Advertisement By JIM TANKERSLEYMARCH 2, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî After making good on tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks that business leaders wanted, President Trump has turned to a part of his economic agenda that many of them feared: tariffs. Those leaders worry that Mr. Trump, by imposing stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum, will set off a trade war with other countries. The global tit-for-tat could hurt American exporters and raise costs for manufacturers that rely on a vast supply chain around the world. If that happens, it will crimp economic growth, undermining the stimulative effects of Mr. Trump‚Äôs deregulation push and his signature $1.5 trillion tax cut. The odds of such an outcome now appear to be rising, prompting congressional Republicans to push Mr. Trump in public and in private to reconsider. ‚ÄúIf the president goes through with this, it will kill American jobs ‚Äî that‚Äôs what every trade war ultimately does,‚Äù Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on Friday. ‚ÄúSo much losing.‚Äù Advertisement So far, Mr. Trump is not having any of that criticism, saying on Twitter on Friday that ‚Äútrade wars are good, and easy to win.‚Äù Advertisement That‚Äôs not how trade wars usually go. READ MORE:  ‚Ä¢ The president appeared eager on Friday to defend his decision to levy sweeping tariffs, calling trade wars ‚Äúeasy to win.‚Äù  ‚Ä¢ Many economists say the opposite: that even the prospect of a trade war will hurt economic expansion. ‚Ä¢ In many ways, the tariffs are economically small and symbolically huge. Here‚Äôs why. Even the prospect of a trade war could hurt the economic expansion underway. That‚Äôs because any uncertainty can prompt companies to curtail investment or hold off on hiring. If other countries follow up on their threats to retaliate, the pain could be significant. Beyond tariffs, their tools include taking strategic strikes at certain industries or taking their grievances to the World Trade Organization. Any actions threaten the global supply chains on which the American economy is heavily dependent. The number of workers who will lose out if countries are cut off from America far exceeds the number who stand to gain from the pending tariffs. ‚ÄúIndustries that buy steel and aluminum, not to mention agricultural exporters, employ many times more people than the industries that the president wants to protect,‚Äù said Peter A. Petri, an economist and trade expert at Brandeis University‚Äôs International Business School. ‚ÄúWhether we go through with his approach is anyone‚Äôs guess, but business investment depends on predictable policy, and relentless chaos takes its toll even if cooler heads prevail on the policies that the president is tweeting about.‚Äù Mr. Trump‚Äôs planned tariffs would, in effect, levy a tax of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. The goal is to counter China, Russia and other countries that have flooded the global markets with cheap products and made it harder for the American steel industry to compete. If put into effect, the tariffs would raise the price of steel and aluminum, squeezing automakers, beverage manufacturers and other industries that buy a lot of those materials. That would increase prices for consumers, kill some jobs in those industries or both. The tariffs would almost certainly provoke a response from America‚Äôs trading partners ‚Äî and not just China and Russia, because they would apply to every other country. On Friday, the European Union threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs of its own on some goods from America, including bluejeans, bourbon and motorcycles. Advertisement If the back-and-forth stopped there, the American economy would lose 0.1 percent of its output this year, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics. That loss would cost the country 190,000 jobs. What worries many economists is the prospect that the retaliation will go even further. A cycle of increasingly harsh tariffs would slam the brakes on global growth. Here is one way the dispute could worsen: By provoking responses from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs could derail the current renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trump could pull the United States out of that agreement, which would erect new and damaging trade barriers on agricultural exports from states such as Iowa. Another possibility is that other countries could file complaints with the World Trade Organization. The W.T.O. could declare that the tariffs violated global trading rules, but the Trump administration, which has marginalized the organization, could choose to ignore it. Such a move would stir chaos in the global trading regime. It would be like ejecting the referee from a playoff basketball game. A free-for-all could ensue, with countries levying tariffs or subsidizing domestic exporters in ways the W.T.O. would never allow. Mr. Zandi estimates that a Nafta breakdown would cost the United States 1.8 million jobs. He calculates that a full global trade war, while far less likely, would carry much higher risks, including nearly four million lost American jobs.

And some economists, particularly those on the left, even saw a possible bright side. Jared Bernstein, an economist in the Obama administration who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, expects some counter-tariffs, maybe from China on food products. Advertisement ‚ÄúYou always hear trade war at these moments,‚Äù Mr. Bernstein said. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs always wrong, but it usually is.‚Äù Thea M. Lee, a trade economist and the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said the tariffs could actually help global markets. They would punish countries that overproduce steel and aluminum, she said, and bring stability and certainty to producers of those metals in the United States. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not actually in anybody‚Äôs interest to spiral downward and get into a massive retaliatory situation,‚Äù Ms. Lee said. ‚ÄúI think there will be some immediate reactions, but I don‚Äôt think it will spiral out of control.‚Äù From the beginning of his insurgent 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has seen ‚Äúwinning‚Äù on trade as critical for the economy. Reducing trade deficits, he has argued, will work in tandem with lowering taxes and reducing federal regulations to supercharge growth. Mr. Trump took several steps last year to freeze or roll back regulations, and he signed a $1.5 trillion tax-cut bill in December. He also took initial steps to reorient trade policy, pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and embarking on the fractious renegotiation of Nafta. While economic growth accelerated, the trade deficit in goods and services widened to $566 billion last year, the largest amount since 2008. The goods deficit with China hit $375 billion, a record. The tariffs that Mr. Trump announced Thursday were his boldest move yet on trade. They were also a reminder to the Republican establishment that his theory of the economy is sometimes at odds with traditional free-market conservatism, despite much overlap. On Thursday, the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board called the tariffs the ‚Äúbiggest policy blunder of his presidency.‚Äù The top two Republicans in Congress ‚Äî the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan ‚Äî were imploring Mr. Trump privately to reconsider. Advertisement Mr. Trump, though, casts himself as protecting an industry that he sees as endangered. Raw steel production in America remains higher than it was 25 years ago, but it is down significantly from the 1970s. Just under 140,000 Americans work in the steel industry, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. While Mr. Trump‚Äôs stand is likely to give him a boost in industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, which were both key to his 2016 victory, a trade war may harm other manufacturing strongholds that are home to his base voters. Last year, researchers at the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Metropolitan Policy Program reported that smaller metropolitan areas would be disproportionately hurt by a trade shock. The 10 that were most vulnerable, because of their economic reliance on exports, were in Indiana, Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina and Alabama ‚Äî all states Mr. Trump carried.

Technology,"Advertisement By NATHANIEL POPPERAPRIL 22, 2018  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Gary Gensler was one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration, the finance chief for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign and, before both of those jobs, a partner at Goldman Sachs. Now, like many other big names from business and government, he is plunging into the world of the blockchain, the data-tracking technology introduced by Bitcoin. Mr. Gensler, 60, has recently gone to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he will write and teach about the potential he sees for blockchains to change the financial world. He will also use his position to warn about how many of the current projects in the world of virtual currencies, including some of the biggest, are likely to face a significant moment of reckoning with regulators. Advertisement Mr. Gensler is set to say in a speech at M.I.T. on Monday that the second and third most widely used virtual currencies, Ether and Ripple, have most likely been issued and traded in violation of American securities regulations. Advertisement ‚ÄúThere is a strong case for both of them ‚Äî but particularly Ripple ‚Äî that they are noncompliant securities,‚Äù he said in an interview. He believes Bitcoin, the original virtual currency, can remain exempt from securities regulations. Mr. Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the agency that Mr. Gensler led from 2009 to 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are in the middle of determining how to categorize and crack down on many of the virtual currencies created in recent years. Most of the focus has been on smaller currencies that were issued through so-called initial coin offerings, or I.C.O.s, a method of fund-raising in which entrepreneurs sell custom virtual currencies. But Mr. Gensler believes that better-known virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities, given the way they have been created and sold. ‚Äú2018 is going to be a very interesting time,‚Äù Mr. Gensler said. ‚ÄúOver 1,000 previously issued initial coin offerings, and over 100 exchanges that offer I.C.O.s, are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with U.S. securities law.‚Äù The people behind both Ether and Ripple have argued that their tokens are not securities. But there are signs that the S.E.C. could be receptive to Mr. Gensler‚Äôs argument. Regulators have indicated in private meetings with industry participants that they are considering whether Ether should be categorized as a security. Advertisement All the outstanding Ether were worth around $65 billion at Sunday‚Äôs price, while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around $35 billion. If they are deemed to be securities, it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded. That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their prices. Mr. Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Before he got into office, some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks. But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisis.

Joi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, said the combination of Mr. Gensler‚Äôs record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to M.I.T. Mr. Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who don‚Äôt have a financial interest in them, though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin software. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that you have a core group of people who aren‚Äôt in it for the money, and who care about the proper architecture for the long run,‚Äù he said. Mr. Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fall. The original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is needed. Advertisement While most blockchain experiments are in an early stage, Mr. Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industry. For now, though, his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulated. Most industry experts, including Mr. Gensler, assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization, and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers. Some other virtual currencies, like Litecoin and Monero, have similar designs. But Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation. Ether could get off the hook, Mr. Gensler said, because its development has been more decentralized recently, and new Ether tokens are now given out to so-called miners through a network. Aya Miyaguchi, the head of the Ethereum Foundation, said in an email that the foundation ‚Äúneither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether, and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds (under 1 percent of all Ether) is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participants.‚Äù But Mr. Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token, known as XRP, to avoid being categorized as a security. The company that oversees Ripple‚Äôs development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable, he said. A spokesman for the company Ripple, Tom Channick, said XRP should not be a security. ‚ÄúXRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple, and they are not paid dividends,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúXRP exists independent of Ripple, was created before the company and will exist after it.‚Äù Mr. Gensler, who has no virtual currency investments, said he was not tied to any coin‚Äôs winning the race. But he does think changes are necessary before blockchains can go mainstream. Advertisement ‚ÄúI would be surprised if 10 years from now this isn‚Äôt somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut so much of the stuff that is being promoted now will not be around.‚Äù Follow Nathaniel Popper on Twitter: @nathanielpopper.

Sports,"Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJUNE 7, 2017  LeBron James and Kyrie Irving were nearly unstoppable for most of Game 3 of the N.B.A. finals. But even as the Cleveland Cavaliers kept an iron grip on the lead in the fourth quarter, Coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors repeatedly told his players that the Cavs‚Äô stars would eventually wear down as long as the Warriors stuck to the game plan and never gave up. ‚ñ† Follow our live coverage of the N.B.A. finals Game 4 here. At times Kerr‚Äôs advice must have seemed unrealistic, as James raced to 39 points, with Irving right behind him at 38 points. But his words eventually proved prophetic as the Cavaliers unraveled in the game‚Äôs final minutes, allowing the Warriors to go on an 11-0 run, erasing what had been a 6-point lead for Cleveland and putting the Cavaliers in a 3-0 hole in the series. The Cavaliers, who left the crowd at Cleveland‚Äôs Quicken Loans arena stunned by the improbable collapse, will have people looking for things to blame, and there were a few moments in the closing seconds that appeared to seal the team‚Äôs fate. Here‚Äôs what happened in Game 3: Kyrie Irving put on a show all game, repeatedly getting to the basket and throwing up shots that were as improbable as they were accurate. It was the same demoralizing manner in which he helped engineer Cleveland‚Äôs comeback in last year‚Äôs finals, with nearly every Golden State shot being answered by one from Irving or James.              Kyrie Irving ends the first half in style! #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/ve9OQV6dla  But with just under two minutes remaining, Irving‚Äôs magic ran out and his driving layup failed to find its way through the hoop as he fell out of bounds. Despite Draymond Green having been in perfect position for a rebound, Irving dove back to the ball and wrestled it away from the larger forward, but the possession ended for Cleveland when LeBron James missed a 12-footer. Advertisement ‚ÄîFollowing a missed 3-pointer by Kyle Korver, Kevin Durant collected the rebound and took care of things himself, dribbling to the other side of the court before simply pulling up in front of James for a 3-pointer that gave the Warriors a 114-113 lead with 45 seconds remaining.              Lebron kicks out to Korver, Durant takes the ball shoots a 3 over Lebron. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/GH59aOzb3Y  The boldness to even take the shot, let alone make it, was exactly what the Warriors were looking for when they signed the former M.V.P. Advertisement ‚ÄúNot many people are taking that shot,‚Äù Green said. ‚ÄúHe knew he was taking that shot the whole way. That was huge. He wanted that moment.‚Äù James, who claimed fatigue did not play a part in the collapse, failed to make a strong attempt to contest the shot. He claimed it was strategy, not exhaustion, which gave Durant some room to work with. ‚ÄúHe uses a rhythm dribble to get a good look,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúWhen K.D. shoots, he falls forward, and I wanted to get a contest. The last thing I want to do is foul a jump shooter.‚Äù Andre Iguodala won a Finals M.V.P. award in 2015 largely because of his containment of James, and while he may not have had quite as much of an impact in this series, he showed he could still dial it up when necessary. Coach Steve Kerr played the versatile wing for the entire fourth quarter and it paid off when James got the ball in the corner with 10 seconds remaining and his team down by 3 points. James started to elevate for a 3-point attempt but before he could get the ball in position to shoot, Iguodala swatted it away cleanly.              Andre Iguodala's block on LeBron is poetic. One season everything goes wrong for you and now you're back to being a hero. #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/CMQd77T1Kx  James, who kicked Iguodala between the legs on the shot attempt in a body movement more typically associated with Draymond Green, pushed past Iguodala to regain possession of the ball, but in doing so he stepped out of bounds and ended any realistic chance of his team tying the game. The Cavaliers now find themselves down 3-0 in the series. ESPN Stats & Information reminds us that N.B.A. teams that have fallen behind 3-0 in a seven-game series are a perfectly imperfect 0-126 at mounting a comeback. Advertisement The Warriors, meanwhile, will have a chance to finish off an unprecedented 16-game sweep of the N.B.A.‚Äôs postseason if they win Game 4 on Friday, which would also make them the ninth team to sweep the N.B.A. Finals. Talk of an undefeated postseason had been brushed aside prior to Game 3, but with a 3-0 lead, Stephen Curry was finally willing to acknowledge it as a worthy goal. ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôre in that situation, why not take care of business and finish the job?‚Äù he asked. But if there is a glimmer of hope for the stunned Cavaliers, no team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit until last year ‚Äî when Cleveland did that against Golden State.

At least one member of the Cavaliers seemed (briefly) confident in the team‚Äôs ability to come back from the 3-0 deficit. J.R. Smith tweeted ‚Äî then immediately deleted ‚Äî a bold prediction: ‚ÄúCavs in 7.‚Äù Smith told reporters that his Twitter account was hacked and claimed he didn‚Äôt send the tweet.              JR Smith takes to twitter, a bold prediction pic.twitter.com/9H5DLgxktm  Here‚Äôs how the Warriors won: Game 3 tipped off at 9:11 p.m. Eastern, with Zaza Pachulia of the Warriors winning the opening tip over Tristan Thompson of the Cavaliers. Despite that, the Cavaliers were first on the board with a layup by Kyrie Irving, and after Pachulia was called for a traveling violation, J.R. Smith knocked down a 3-pointer. It was Smith‚Äôs first field goal since the opening points of Game 1. The Cavaliers have an early 13-9 lead with 8:30 remaining in the first quarter, but in a potentially bad omen for the Cavaliers, the Warriors are hot from 3-point range with Kevin Durant hitting two and Klay Thompson hitting one. At the game‚Äôs first timeout, LeBron James and Kevin Durant seem determined to put on a show. James is up to 9 points and 2 assists, while Durant has 8 points on two 3-pointers and an alley-oop he managed to complete despite initially coming up short. For the Cavaliers to keep their nice flow on offense, keeping Draymond Green out of the game as much as possible is key, and with the power forward already having picked up one personal foul he will undoubtedly be less aggressive in the game‚Äôs early going. That gives Cleveland an opportunity to push the ball inside to take advantage of his caution. Or benefit from his inability to control himself. On a Klay Thompson 3-pointer that tied the game at 19-19, LeBron James collided with Tristan Thompson and stayed on the ground for an extended period. James was holding his head, and it appeared Thompson‚Äôs right shoulder had collided with James‚Äôs jaw, but after a commercial break he was back on the court, having been checked out on the bench briefly by medical personnel. Advertisement On Cleveland‚Äôs first possession after the break, James hit a shot in the lane over the outstretched arms of JaVale McGee, drawing a foul and proving that he was fine. The Cavaliers were expected to try to slow things down at home after allowing 35 and 40 points in the first quarters of Games 1 and 2 on the road. Game 3 looks a lot like the first two games, however, with Cleveland trailing Golden State 39-32. LeBron James is once again doing a tremendous job offensively, with 15 points, but Golden State set an N.B.A. finals record with 9 3-pointers in the quarter, and Cleveland may want to set their sights on slowing down Klay Thompson. When he is hot, Thompson can be an even more devastating shooter than Stephen Curry, and the shooting guard lived up to his position‚Äôs name in the first quarter with 16 points on just seven field goal attempts. Cold for must of the postseason, Thompson started to come alive in Game 2, and is now 4 for 5 from 3-point range in Game 3, while the Warriors as a group are 9 for 14. James will need more help in terms of scoring, but the larger problem may be Golden State continuing to win the battle for rebounds. They had 10 to Cleveland‚Äôs 6 in the quarter despite Zaza Pachulia being sent to the bench after 5 minutes because of foul trouble. The game was immediately more physical at the start of the second quarter, with a lot of contact on both ends of the court. The change in mood greatly benefited Cleveland, with a 7-0 run bringing them back to a tie score. The quarter‚Äôs first minute included a pass by LeBron James that went through the basket for two points and a dunk by Kyle Korver, who dunked just once during the regular season. The game was briefly tied at 39, but after a 3-point play by David West the Warriors are back up to a 4-point lead with 10 minutes left in the quarter. Advertisement The pace of the game may have slowed, but LeBron James continues to be able to do seemingly anything he wants against Golden State‚Äôs formidable defense. The Cavaliers‚Äô forward has 23 points on 10 of 11 shooting while the rest of his team has combined for just 22 points. His teammates are shooting 5 of 18 from the field and no other player has more than 6 points. The most stark stat in favor of James, however, may be plus/minus. The Cavaliers trail by 1 point ‚Äî and James has only sat out 2 minutes ‚Äî but he is a plus-9 so far. Kevin Love is a minus-8 and Kyrie Irving is a minus-5. There was not a lot of scoring in the second quarter, with Cleveland shrinking the Warriors‚Äô lead to six points at the half. Despite the downturn in points, there was plenty of action, with both teams aggressively going after the ball on defense, and bodies simply crushing into each other in what was almost assuredly an attempt by the Cavaliers to slow things down and take advantage of the smaller Warriors players. While the quarter included an extended argument between Stephen Curry and Iman Shumpert following a foul by the Cleveland guard, the biggest development for Cleveland was Draymond Green talking his way into a technical foul for arguing about his third foul. Green has not necessarily been at his best in these finals, but he is Golden State‚Äôs most important player on defense and one of their key playmakers on offense. He had been a model citizen in the finals before the technical, but the Cavaliers will have to hope they have ignited his combustible personality. For all of the physicality in the game, the Cavaliers were still been unable to disrupt the Warriors‚Äô ability to move the ball around rapidly on every possession. Golden State had 21 assists on their 23 field goals in the half, and they are nearly unbeatable in any game in which they top 30 assists as a team. LeBron James led all scorers in the half with 27 points, but Klay Thompson was right behind him with 21. Kyrie Irving had 17, including a last-second layup that improbably found the basket despite the star guard throwing it up over a swarm of Warriors defenders. Third quarters have been difficult for Cleveland in this series, with Golden State racing off to huge leads, but things are off to a good start in Game 3 with the Cavaliers narrowing the Warriors‚Äô lead to one point thanks to a 7-2 run. Cleveland even got some help from Golden State when a monstrous dunk by Kevin Durant was waived off thanks to a moving screen by Zaza Pachulia. Draymond Green also drew his fourth foul of the game. Getting Green into foul trouble was a priority for the Cavaliers, and the star power forward may be forced to miss a large amount of the second half if Coach Steve Kerr wants to ensure that he will be available for crunchtime. The Kyrie Irving of last year‚Äôs finals appears to have finally arrived for this year‚Äôs series. The star guard now has 27 points and has repeatedly answered any scoring by Golden State with a series of circus layups that find friendly bounces through the rim. Advertisement While Games 1 and 2 were mostly defined by LeBron James‚Äôs best going against the best of Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, Game 3 has had some variety with James and Irving combining for 54 points while Klay Thompson and Curry have combined for 43. Cleveland has also gotten far more help from J.R. Smith, who has 12 points and is 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Smith has also has picked up three fouls which could be an issue. The Cavaliers were written off by plenty of people after falling behind 2-0 in the series, but the third quarter finally belonged to them as Cleveland outscored Golden State 33-22 and will enter the fourth quarter with a 94-89 lead. Cleveland has gotten 65 points from LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, and just 29 from the rest of the team, but Kevin Love chipped in with 8 rebounds and an astounding 6 steals. He has also drawn fouls in several instances by letting the smaller Warriors fight just a bit too hard while battling with him under the basket. Golden State was clearly frustrated on the court in the third, with shots missing and the ball not moving around nearly as much. They finished the third with just 4 assists after they had 21 in the first half. For Cleveland to hold onto the lead in the fourth quarter, they will need to keep Golden State frustrated offensively, while keeping James and Irving at maximum intensity for as much of the quarter as possible. A needless loose ball foul on a rebounding attempt in which he was outnumbered three-to-one under the basket resulted in Draymond Green picking up his fifth foul of the game. Despite that ‚Äî and Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry opening up the fourth quarter on the bench ‚Äî the Warriors actually kept pace over the first four minutes, keeping Cleveland‚Äôs 5-point lead in place. Advertisement For the Warriors to keep their 14-game postseason winning streak going, they will need Durant and Curry to get back into the game and for them to get back to the two-man wrecking crew that they were in Games 1 and 2. With the Cavaliers leading for much of the second half it appeared Cleveland would finally win a game, but an improbable run in the final seconds of the game has the Golden State Warriors leading by 3 points with one possession remaining in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. Kevin Durant got hot at the end of the game, hitting a huge 3-pointer to give the Warriors the lead late in the game. The crowd in Cleveland was eerily quiet as they realized the Warriors were now likely to win a 15th consecutive postseason game. We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page.

Sports,"Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAJUNE 10, 2017  CLEVELAND ‚Äî It was impossible. It was inconceivable. There was no way the Cavaliers could escape from the wreckage of this series and slow the Golden State Warriors‚Äô march to immortality. The Cavaliers heard all the doubts ahead of Friday‚Äôs Game 4 of the N.B.A. finals. The noise was impossible to ignore. But with every dazzling layup by Kyrie Irving and each impassioned fist pump from LeBron James, the Cavaliers and their fans at Quicken Loans Arena found hope, a commodity that had been in short supply. In a game played at a breakneck pace, and one that seemed to have more physical contact than a taekwondo tournament, the Cavaliers stunned the Warriors, 137-116, to stay alive in the series. ‚ÄúBelieveland is not going to give up,‚Äù Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said, referring to the nickname adopted by the Cleveland fan base. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to keep fighting. We‚Äôre going to keep scrapping.‚Äù Advertisement The Warriors lead the best-of-seven series by three games to one, and they will have another opportunity to clinch the title in Game 5 on Monday in Oakland, Calif. But the loss was a missed opportunity for the Warriors ‚Äî not only to celebrate a championship on Cleveland‚Äôs home court, but to do something no team in league history had ever done: sweep its way to a perfect record in the postseason. ‚ÄúI think we played a desperate team on their home floor, a great team with great players, and they came out and handed it to us,‚Äù Golden State Coach Steve Kerr said. ‚ÄúSimple as that.‚Äù Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

The Cavaliers dealt the Warriors their first defeat since April 10, in their second-to-last game of the regular season. It was a night for the Cavaliers to feel good about themselves again, although it all came with a caveat: No team has come back from a three-games-to-none series deficit to win the finals. The Cavaliers are glad they have an opportunity to become the first. ‚ÄúYou hear some chatter going on throughout the Warriors locker room in terms of them trying to end it here,‚Äù Irving said, adding, ‚ÄúWe had to leave it all out there.‚Äù Advertisement Irving, the Cavaliers‚Äô acrobatic point guard, scored 40 points, and James, their all-world forward, finished with his second triple-double of the series: 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists. Kevin Love added 23 points for the Cavaliers, who shot 52.9 percent from the field. J. R. Smith had five of the team‚Äôs 24 3-pointers, which were a finals record. The Cavaliers seem to thrive in adverse situations. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúIt causes too much stress, man. I‚Äôm stressed out. Keep doing this every year. But listen, at the end of the day, we just got some resilient guys.‚Äù After scoring 49 points in the first quarter and 86 points in the first half ‚Äî both N.B.A. postseason records ‚Äî the Cavaliers survived a frantic third quarter. James threw a pass off the backboard to himself for a dunk. Kevin Durant later jawed with him, drawing security personnel onto the court. (‚ÄúWe were just talking,‚Äù Durant said.) Draymond Green was ejected ‚Äî and then un-ejected, after it was determined that an earlier technical foul had been incorrectly assessed to him instead of Kerr.              WOW. pic.twitter.com/T2BjBdRvTJ  There was more: Zaza Pachulia, the Warriors‚Äô starting center, appeared to strike the Cavaliers‚Äô Iman Shumpert in the midsection during a scrum. Both were assessed technicals. In other words, it was a big mess. But the Cavaliers emerged from the muck with a 115-96 lead entering the fourth quarter, which proved too much for even the Warriors to overcome. ‚ÄúI was hoping they would get tired,‚Äù Kerr said of Irving and James, ‚Äúbut they didn‚Äôt seem to get tired tonight. They were phenomenal.‚Äù The Cavaliers played suffocating defense on Stephen Curry, limiting him to 4-of-13 shooting. Durant scored a team-high 35 points, and Green had 16 points and 14 rebounds. ‚ÄúJust one of those games,‚Äù Curry said. ‚ÄúNot going to overreact to one. Obviously, I can play better and want to play better and will play better.‚Äù Advertisement As game time approached, crowds formed outside the arena. But the general direction of the series had put a damper on the festivities. The air seemed thick with resignation. A sandwich board at a restaurant made a sad plea: ‚ÄúCleveland Don‚Äôt Quit!‚Äù The Cavaliers were coming off a 118-113 loss in Wednesday‚Äôs Game 3, a heartbreaking result that put them in a giant hole. James and Irving had combined for 77 points, yet the Cavaliers still lost. Another title for the Warriors seemed inevitable, and perhaps it still does, though the Cavaliers rallied from a three-games-to-one series deficit to wrest a title away from Golden State last year. And the Cavaliers have pride. Lue said he could sense the team‚Äôs focus at its pregame shootaround. ‚ÄúHad a great vibe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGuys were upbeat. There wasn‚Äôt no hanging heads or sadness. Guys were into it.‚Äù On Friday, Smith and Irving opened the game with back-to-back 3-pointers. The Cavaliers were not going to back down. Later, James drove to the hoop, absorbed contact and scored on a layup. He punctuated the play by pumping his fist ‚Äî once, twice, three times ‚Äî and ‚ÄúM.V.P.‚Äù chants filled the building as he went to the foul line. Kerr needed just 2 minutes 44 seconds of the first quarter to elapse before he called his first timeout. It did little good. The Cavaliers quickly pushed their lead to 17, and the Warriors augmented their opponent‚Äôs hot shooting by getting into foul trouble. Curry, Green and Klay Thompson picked up two fouls apiece, and the Cavaliers had a 49-33 lead at the end of the first quarter. ‚ÄúThey made some tough ones,‚Äù Durant said. When the Warriors threatened in the second quarter, trimming the lead to 12, Smith connected on a 3-pointer from 30 feet with the shot clock winding down. The lead was back to 20 when James pulled up for a short jumper, and the crowd ‚Äî so forlorn just two days before ‚Äî went bananas. Irving and James combined for 50 points while shooting 18 of 25 from the field as the Cavaliers surged to an 86-68 halftime lead. The Cavaliers had scored 91 points in all of Game 1. Given the long odds facing the Cavaliers and the strength of their opponent, their overall effort was nothing short of extraordinary. Now, the hard part: doing it three more times.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Dani Rodrik President Trump‚Äôs tough talk on trade and the tariffs he recently imposed on imported washing machines and solar panels, as well as the ones he threatened on foreign steel and aluminum, would seem straight out of the populist playbook. But in terms of targeting the real grievances of his popular base, they largely miss the mark. The early history of American populism, culminating in the New Deal, suggests a more productive and less damaging kind of populism. When populism succeeds, it does so not by cosmetic gimmicks but by going after the roots of economic injustice directly. At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, the 36-year-old former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan delivered what became one of the most famous lines of American political oratory: ‚ÄúYou shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.‚Äù Bryan‚Äôs immediate target was the gold standard, an emblem of the globalization of his day, which he blamed for the economic difficulties of what he called the ‚Äútoiling masses.‚Äù Bryan ran for president that year as the joint candidate of the Democratic Party and of the People‚Äôs Party, also known as the Populist Party. The populists of the late 19th century had many grievances, but the flames of their discontent were fanned by opposition to economic globalization. Under the gold standard, markets for money, goods, capital and labor had become intertwined among nations as never before. As John Maynard Keynes would later rue, a well-to-do inhabitant in a major capital city like London ‚Äúcould order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.‚Äù Global competition also drove American agricultural prices down. And the rules of the gold standard enforced tight money and credit conditions ‚Äî what we would today call austerity policies. The consequent economic distress among farmers in the South and the West fueled the populist movement. The populists viewed the railroads as well as the financial and commercial interests of the Northeast, the defenders of the gold standard, as their main opponents. Throwing off the shackles of the gold standard and reclaiming national monetary sovereignty became their rallying cry. Populism in the 21st century is as much a reaction to globalization as its late-19th-century version. While the backlash in the United States and Europe differs in specific details, the broad outlines are similar. Large segments of the workers in these advanced economies ‚Äî older, less-skilled manufacturing employees and the communities they live in ‚Äî have seen their earnings decline or stagnate and their relative social status take a big hit. These groups see governments as increasingly in the pocket of financial and business elites, the big winners of globalization. The discontent in turn fuels populist leaders who promise to wrest control from faceless global market forces and re-empower the nation-state. The populist backlash unleashed by advanced stages of economic globalization should not have been a surprise, least of all to economists. The warning signs are right there in the basic economic theory we teach in the classroom. Yes, globalization expands economic opportunities: There are gains from trade. But globalization also entails stark distributional consequences, with some groups almost always left worse off. Factory closings, job displacement and offshoring are the flip side of the gains from trade. What is more, these redistributive effects loom larger relative to the overall economic gains as globalization advances and trade agreements begin to aim at less consequential barriers. In other words, in its late stages, globalization looks less and less as if it is expanding the overall economic pie and more and more as though it is simply taking money from some groups and giving it to others. In principle, an active government can take the edge off the resentment produced by redistribution. In Western Europe, an extensive welfare state has historically provided the safety nets that in turn enabled levels of economic openness that are much higher than in the United States. But often the response of the government has been to plead incapacity in the face of inexorable global economic realities: ‚ÄúWe cannot tax the winners ‚Äî the wealthy investors, financiers and skilled professionals ‚Äî because they are footloose and they would move to other countries.‚Äù This reinforces populists‚Äô yearning to reassert national economic control. William Jennings Bryan ultimately failed in his quest for the presidency, and the People‚Äôs Party imploded because of regional and ideological divisions. But many of the Populists‚Äô economic ideas, such as the progressive income tax, regulations on big business and much greater government control of the economy, were absorbed by the progressive movement and became part of the political mainstream. It wasn‚Äôt until 1933 that the Populists‚Äô main plank, the end of the gold standard, was adopted. By then the United States was mired in the Great Depression, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had decided the economy needed the monetary boost that adherence to the gold standard precluded. Internationalists complained that Roosevelt acted unilaterally, but he had little patience with orthodox economic ideas or shackles ‚Äî foreign or domestic ‚Äî on his conduct of economic policy. At home, he had to fight conservative courts to put his New Deal reforms in place. By his day‚Äôs standards, and perhaps also today‚Äôs, Roosevelt was an economic populist. But the New Deal reinvigorated the market economy and saved capitalism from itself. It may also have saved democracy, as it helped staved off the dangerous demagogues and chauvinist ideologues, of which there were plenty (such as Father Coughlin and Huey Long). The lesson of history is not only that globalization and the populist backlash are tightly linked. It is also that the bad kind of populism spawned by globalization may require a good kind of populism to fend it off. President Trump and his European counterparts have capitalized on the economic difficulties of the middle and lower-middle classes by wrapping them in narratives that exploit prevailing ethno-nationalist prejudices. In the United States, they attribute declining wages and job prospects to Mexican immigrants, Chinese exporters and the federal government‚Äôs preoccupation with minority groups at the expense of the white middle class. In Europe, they lay the blame for the erosion of the welfare state and public services on competition from immigrants and refugees. But none of this really helps the middle and lower-middle classes. Worse, the illiberal politics of the strategy undermines democracy. If our economic rules empower corporations and financial interests excessively, then the correct response is to rewrite those rules ‚Äî at home as well as abroad. If trade agreements serve mainly to reshuffle income to capital and corporations, the answer is to rebalance them to make them friendlier to labor and society at large. If governments feel themselves powerless to institute the tax policies and regulations needed to address the dislocations caused by economic and technological shocks, the solution is not just to seek more national autonomy but also to deploy it toward such reforms. A populism of this kind can seem like a frontal attack on the economic sacred cows of the day ‚Äî just as earlier waves of American populism were. But it is an honest populism that stands a chance of achieving its stated objectives, without harming fundamental democratic norms of tolerance and equal citizenship.

Technology,"A proud father. A brilliant friend. Lucky in love. Inherited wealth. And an opioid addict, dead at 54. Nicole Hanley and Matthew Mellon in 2014.CreditDesiree Navarro/WireImage Supported by By Katherine Rosman and Jonah Engel Bromwich Four years ago, Matthew Mellon was living in an art-filled apartment in the Pierre hotel with his young second wife, Nicole Hanley. He had three young children, the eldest of whom lives with his first wife, Tamara Mellon, a founder of Jimmy Choo.  His marriage to Ms. Hanley was breaking up by 2015. The next year, he told the New York Post he had been taking 80 OxyContin pills a day, spending $100,000 a month on the habit. And, last weekend, Mr. Mellon traveled by private plane to Cancun, Mexico. He was going to get a ‚Äútouch-up treatment‚Äù at a rehab facility he had visited earlier this year, said Mr. Mellon‚Äôs stepfather, J. Reeve Bright ‚Äî and had been sober for about 70 days. He never made it there. ‚ÄúHe was supposed to check in Monday morning but we received word around 9 a.m. that he has passed away,‚Äù said Dr. Alberto Sol√†, the medical director of Clear Sky Recovery, an ibogaine treatment center. Mr. Mellon's family is awaiting results of an autopsy and toxicology tests being conducted by the Mexican government, Mr. Bright said.  Earlier in the week, Mr. Mellon visited with his parents in Delray Beach, Fla., where he was raised. ‚ÄúWe had dinner with him on Saturday night, a joyful dinner and a very memorable dinner, more than we realized at the time,‚Äù Mr. Bright said. ‚ÄúHe hugged and kissed his mother and he hugged and kissed me. He said, ‚ÄòI love you, Dad,‚Äô and I said that I loved him. And 48 hours later he was dead.‚Äù Mr. Mellon was a member of one of the country‚Äôs oldest banking families: the great-great-great grandson of Judge Thomas Mellon, the Mellon Bank patriarch. Matthew Mellon‚Äôs father, Karl N. Mellon, died in 1983 at the age of 45, by suicide.  Matthew‚Äôs last name and social connections resulted in a lot of breathless press coverage of his wealth. It's unclear how much he actually inherited or earned, and what remained after many years of substance abuse. (Dominick Dunne said that Mr. Mellon received $25 million when he turned 21.) Mr. Mellon, who had dyslexia, attended Phelps, a boarding school outside of Philadelphia. He was raised by his mother, Anne, and Mr. Bright; they married in 1975. Mr. Mellon received a bachelor‚Äôs degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989.  According to his first wife, Tamara Mellon, he took his first trip to rehab while still in school. After college, he tried for careers in the music and fashion industries, marrying Ms. Mellon in 2000. The two met in a 12-step program.  Ms. Mellon installed her new husband as the creative director of Jimmy Choo‚Äôs collection of men‚Äôs shoes, but their relationship was turbulent in the office and at home. In 2003, Mr. Mellon started his own shoe company, Harrys of London. ‚ÄúWhen your wife makes $100 million during the course of your marriage, it‚Äôs quite a shocker,‚Äù he told W magazine in a 2007 interview. ‚ÄúI felt like my masculinity had been stripped from me. I was no longer the big man in the relationship. I feel like my balls are in a jar, like a Damien Hirst artwork on the mantelpiece. And here I am, ball-less.‚Äù  The divorce was acrimonious, and Mr. Mellon was tried in a British court amid allegations he had tried to hack into his wife‚Äôs email. He was cleared of the charge. His lawyer argued in court the Mr. Mellon was too disorganized to have pulled off the crime. ‚ÄúHis former wife spent most of her 90-minute testimony portraying Mellon, a former cocaine addict, as a loving but bumbling incompetent. She said he ‚Äòmissed planes like other people missed buses,‚Äô‚Äù the Telegraph reported at the trial‚Äôs conclusion. The exes eventually became friends. Mr. Mellon remained interested in fashion for several years. He started another label, Degrees of Freedom, a luxury athleisure brand, with his fianc√©e Noelle Reno. They never wed, but in 2010, Mr. Mellon married Ms. Hanley, herself a member of a wealthy family (her father was inducted into the Petroleum Hall of Fame in 2015). They had two children and together built a fashion line, Hanley Mellon, which was the subject of a New York Times story in 2014 that exposed the two to mockery. By 2015, the marriage was dissolving.  Mr. Mellon remained close to both his former wives. ‚ÄúHis ex-wives are possibly even more devastated than his mother and I are,‚Äù Mr. Bright said. ‚ÄúWe were laughing as we were looking at pictures earlier. There was a picture of Matthew standing between Tamara and Nicole and all of them are smiling. I don‚Äôt know how he did it!‚Äù  Most recently, Mr. Mellon had been spending time with Kick Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Ms. Kennedy, who had been working on her uncle Chris Kennedy‚Äôs bid for the Illinois governorship, declined to comment on the nature of their relationship. Mr. Mellon, once chairman of the New York Republican Party Finance Committee, donated more than $5,000 to Mr. Kennedy‚Äôs unsuccessful campaign. Mr. Mellon was also a Republican National Committee delegate for the 2012 presidential election. Toward the end of his marriage to Ms. Hanley, he expanded his professional interests to bitcoin, the cryptocurrency.  ‚ÄúMatthew was very interested in the idea of the blockchain and what bitcoin could be very early on,‚Äù said David Marshack, who was an adviser to Coin.co, a bitcoin payment processor, along with Mr. Mellon. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt understand the underlying 0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs of the technology but understood that the technology could make things cheaper, faster, more efficient.‚Äù  In 2014, Mr. Marshack and Mr. Mellon formed their own company, MellonDrexel, that allowed them to consult companies in the nascent cryptocurrency sector. Mr. Mellon was particularly taken with one of those companies, Ripple, for which he became a global ambassador, using his connections to market the company to banks and to his rich or famous friends. He took much of his compensation in its currency, called XRP. ‚ÄúHe risked everything on it and toward the end of last year, it exploded and made him an awful lot of money,‚Äù Mr. Marshack said. ‚ÄúIt made a bunch of people second-guess their early criticisms. Though, to be fair, the criticisms were completely valid at the time they were made.‚Äù  Throughout his adult life, Mr. Mellon wrestled with drug addiction and was in and out of rehab. ‚ÄúMatthew has struggled,‚Äù his stepfather said, speaking of his son in the present tense. ‚ÄúThere is no question that he has struggled. He has gone through some difficult things in his life. But he pushed and pushed and pushed himself.‚Äù Friends described Mr. Mellon as an avid experimenter who wanted to be an early adopter of the new next thing ‚Äî a good coffee, a good movie or a new apartment. That excitement, they said, may have lent itself to his addiction.  ‚ÄúMatthew‚Äôs head was always in the clouds,‚Äù Mr. Marshack said. ‚ÄúBut he was warm and generous and compassionate. The thing that made him excited about everything was the same thing that got him sick. It was part of him trying to do more, see more, experience more.‚Äù  By 2016, he had become involved in the opioid-addiction treatment called ibogaine, posting from Cancun, ‚Äú#ibogaine Let me know if you ever hit a wall in life and you need help I will send you here for free on me!‚Äù Ibogaine is a plant-based substance banned in the U.S. that provokes hallucinations but also, proponents say, can decrease users‚Äô cravings and symptoms of withdrawal.  He sought treatment at Clear Sky earlier this year. On April 8, a week before he died, a photo was posted to what appeared to be one of Mr. Mellon‚Äôs Instagram accounts. In it, he is smiling ‚Äî and, according to the caption, sober. A week later, he was on a plane headed back to Clear Sky. But upon landing in Mexico, he checked into a hotel rather than going directly to the rehab. His stepfather cried as he discussed the man he and Mr. Mellon‚Äôs mother had raised. ‚ÄúWhen we found out he died, we sat down and we said to each other, ‚ÄòWe know he is in heaven and now all of his struggles are behind him,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe was a kind, caring, generous person. We firmly believe he is now in Heaven.‚Äù Mr. Mellon‚Äôs family has planned a funeral service to take place next weekend at St. Joseph‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Boynton Beach, Fla.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Best of Late Night By Giovanni Russonello In the first year of President Trump‚Äôs administration, the role of late-night TV comedians has changed dramatically ‚Äî perhaps permanently. It‚Äôs almost impossible to watch even five minutes of a show nowadays without some mention of politics. Since February, I‚Äôve written ‚ÄúBest of Late Night,‚Äù a daily column highlighting standout moments from the weeknight talk shows. In a year defined by Mr. Trump‚Äôs unorthodox presidency, each host has seemed to build a personal approach to handling him. On ‚ÄúThe Late Show,‚Äù Stephen Colbert, no stranger to political satire, has tended to focus on the Russia scandal, even taping a week of shows in Russia last summer. Jimmy Kimmel, once a rather apolitical figure, cloaked himself in activist garb, pushing for ‚Äî and against ‚Äî legislation in a way that forebears like Johnny Carson and Jay Leno wouldn‚Äôt have imagined. Even Jimmy Fallon, whose stage persona remains sunny and easygoing, often takes on politics, mostly by emphasizing the silliness ‚Äî not the severity ‚Äî of what unfolds in Washington. ‚ÄúIvanka Trump met with Republican senators today to talk about paid family leave. The senators were like: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll totally pay for your family to leave! How much you want? We‚Äôre in.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî JIMMY FALLON The hosts didn‚Äôt abandon broader cultural concerns, either, confronting topics like the airline industry and the #metoo movement. Here‚Äôs your year-end ‚ÄúBest of Late Night,‚Äù with some of the funniest quips and most memorable moments. Mr. Colbert has tracked the Russia investigation more assiduously than any other host. When the fired F.B.I. director James Comey testified before Congress in June, Mr. Colbert gleefully pointed out that Mr. Comey had taken close notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump, for fear that the president might mischaracterize what had been said. ‚ÄúHe thought Trump might lie? That‚Äôs that razor-sharp F.B.I. instinct in action right there. ‚ÄòLook, fellas, I don‚Äôt want to get out over my skis here, but I think this dead body might not be alive!‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî STEPHEN COLBERT ‚ÄúComey wrote everything down, and all his memos are going to be collected in a new children‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòJames and the Guilty Orange.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî STEPHEN COLBERT Mr. Trump stayed rather quiet on the topic of late-night shows, even as he became their id√©e fixe. But he couldn‚Äôt help attacking Mr. Colbert in May. Mr. Colbert, whose ratings ticked up when he started consistently taking on Mr. Trump about a year ago, welcomed the feud. ‚ÄúMr. Trump, there‚Äôs a lot you don‚Äôt understand, but I never thought one of those things would be show business. Don‚Äôt you know I‚Äôve been trying for a year to get you to say my name? ‚ÄòOh, please, don‚Äôt make me trend on Twitter again! Don‚Äôt throw me in that #briarpatch!‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî STEPHEN COLBERT Mr. Trump has been less restrained about criticizing journalists, and late-night hosts often used their soapbox to push back against his jabs at the news media‚Äôs credibility. ‚ÄúSenator John McCain criticized President Trump‚Äôs attack on the media yesterday and said that stifling the press is how dictators get started. Said Trump: ‚ÄòCool, and then what do they do next?‚Äô [holds up imaginary notepad]‚Äù ‚Äî SETH MEYERS ‚ÄúTrump said it‚Äôs disgusting that the press is allowed to write whatever it wants to write.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters BERLIN ‚Äî Chancellor Angela Merkel praised French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday for giving fresh impetus to the European project, lauding his ""elan"" despite differences between France and Germany over trade policy. Germany is pushing the idea of an agreement to lower tariffs across a broad spectrum of products, but France insists there must first be a permanent and unconditional exemption for the EU from U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. In her weekly podcast, Merkel said Franco-German cooperation worked ""very well"", adding that Macron was a worthy winner of the Charlemagne Prize for service to European unification - an award he is due to receive on Thursday. ""Since taking office, he has, with much elan, with much hope, provided Europe with important impetus,"" she said. Despite her warm words, Macron has won only lukewarm support from Germany for his proposals to reform the euro zone. On the trade issue, EU ministers must soon resolve their differences to give Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom a clear mandate for negotiations with the United States ahead of a June 1 deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump to impose the duties.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Ana Swanson WASHINGTON ‚Äî The global economy is looking stronger than it has in years, but as world leaders gather here this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will be particularly attuned to possible economic disruptions stemming from decisions being made just a few blocks away at the White House. In a report released Tuesday morning, the International Monetary Fund said stronger business investment and trade were buoying the world‚Äôs economy. Global growth is on track to reach an annual rate of 3.9 percent this year and next, propelled by the economies of Europe, Japan, China and the United States. That would be up from 3.8 percent in 2017, which was the strongest growth since 2011. But the spring version of the World Economic Outlook, the fund‚Äôs semiannual report card on the health of the international economy, outlined big risks ‚Äî including the growing likelihood of a trade war and government policies that could overheat the United States economy. Though the report did not mention President Trump by name, some of the risks ‚Äî including a trade war ‚Äî are linked to his policies. Mr. Trump maintains that trading partners have not treated the United States fairly and that his administration must take tough action to level the playing field, including imposing tariffs on steel imports and products from China. In a news conference detailing the report Monday morning, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the research department, said there was a particular risk that fears of a trade war could dampen business investment and spark a sell-off in stock markets and other financial assets. ‚ÄúI suspect if you keep poking at the economic expansion, it could turn around and bite you,‚Äù Mr. Obstfeld said. ‚ÄúThere can be no doubt about it, the big elephant in the room continues to be trade policy,‚Äù said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. Companies are already paying higher prices for materials such as steel and soybeans and are beginning to feel uncertain about how to plan for the future, Mr. Slok said. ‚ÄúThis is hanging as a big dark cloud over the spring meetings this year,‚Äù he said. Mr. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù approach to economic policy has sometimes brought him into conflict with international organizations, which he has criticized as ineffectual. The I.M.F. cautioned Tuesday that the multilateral, rules-based trading system of the World Trade Organization was ‚Äúin danger of being torn apart.‚Äù Another risk is Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax cut which, along with other budget changes, is expected to boost the United States economy by 1.2 percent by 2020, according to the I.M.F. There is concern the tax cuts could cause the economy to overheat, spurring inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates. That could derail future growth and cause financial problems in fast-growing, but risky, emerging markets. In the short run, the I.M.F. expects the tax cuts to help lift economic activity. It forecasts the United States economy to grow by 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019 ‚Äî up from 2.3 percent in 2017 and faster than the fund‚Äôs previous projections. Speaking at a rally in Hialeah, Fla., on Monday, Mr. Trump cheered the effects of the tax cut and the strength of the economy. ‚ÄúThis could be one of the greatest booms ever,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúCongratulations, enjoy your money.‚Äù Outside the United States, global growth is roaring along, lifted by surging exports to China and strong consumption in India. Prices of commodities are going up after two years of declines, and that is good news for countries, like Brazil and Russia, that are big exporters of oil, gas, metal and agricultural products. As it did in earlier reports, the I.M.F. emphasized that the prolonged period of economic growth would eventually end and that policymakers needed to act now prepare for the next downturn. The fund urged governments to make tough adjustments to increase their economic productivity now, while growth remained strong. ‚ÄúThe present good times will not last for long, but sound policies can extend the current upswing,‚Äù Mr. Obstfeld said.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Keith Bradsher and Jane Perlez BEIJING ‚Äî In an elegantly furnished back room at a conference in eastern China in December, a member of the Chinese leadership asked American tech executives for help. The official, Wang Huning, a Communist Party strategist who has spent much of his career sizing up the United States as a geopolitical rival, wanted to know whether President Trump was serious about a trade war with China ‚Äî and whether his American visitors could serve as a channel of communication to the White House. He has not been alone. For the past few months, some of the most powerful men in China ‚Äî allies of President Xi Jinping with longstanding ties and deep experience with the United States ‚Äî have been casting about for a better understanding of Mr. Trump and how to respond to his combative trade agenda, according to several people they have consulted. Vice President Wang Qishan has met in recent weeks with a series of American business leaders and former cabinet officials to question them about Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade threats. Liu He, the Politburo member coordinating economic policy, has done the same. One longtime China scholar in the United States said five officials had visited him seeking advice in the past two weeks alone. In these meetings, the Americans have warned that Mr. Trump‚Äôs complaints should be taken seriously because of widespread frustration in Washington with Chinese policies, especially a $300 billion program to dominate critical high-tech industries, known as Made in China 2025, that has alarmed the United States national security establishment. It is unclear whether that message is making it through to Mr. Xi ‚Äî or whether he has chosen to ignore it after concluding that Mr. Trump is bluffing and that the United States will back off, as it has in the past. [President Trump has found new appeal in the Trans-Pacific Pact. But the pact‚Äôs current members might not make it so easy to come back.] Governing with a new mandate since engineering the removal of presidential term limits last month, Mr. Xi has personally taken control of decision-making in the trade standoff, according to analysts and political insiders with ties to the leadership. His unquestioned authority, some say, has made it more difficult for the party apparatus to deliver news that contradicts him. ‚ÄúWhen you have this kind of regime, you want to report the good story,‚Äù said Tao Jingzhou, a managing partner at the global law firm Dechert who deals with senior Chinese officials. ‚ÄúI have the impression the leadership is not fully briefed about the seriousness of the atmosphere against China in the U.S. establishment.‚Äù The confusion over Mr. Trump‚Äôs stance on trade deepened on Thursday when he said, in a surprise move, that he was considering rejoining the multicountry trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, after abruptly withdrawing the United States from the negotiations last year. Mr. Xi has elevated a coterie of advisers who have built their careers in part on their ability to interpret and handle the United States, perhaps more so than any of his predecessors. But they seem surprised and confused by Mr. Trump‚Äôs rapid-fire decisions and trade threats, like the move to impose punitive tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese imports, according to many who have met with them. These men include Wang Huning, the party‚Äôs chief ideologue, who has written a book about his visits to the United States as a young scholar; Wang Qishan, Mr. Xi‚Äôs most powerful lieutenant, who has cultivated relationships on Wall Street for decades; and Mr. Liu, the vice premier in charge of the economy, who has master‚Äôs degrees from Seton Hall and Harvard. Mr. Xi has also promoted Yang Jiechi, a former ambassador to Washington, to the party‚Äôs 25-member Politburo. Despite this deep bench of expertise, the Chinese leadership appears at a loss, grasping for interlocutors in an American political landscape that has been scrambled by Mr. Trump. For more than two decades, Beijing has watched corporate America make the case for trade with China and one American president after another embrace that agenda. But Mr. Trump has defied that pattern. ‚ÄúChinese experts do not understand the current state of the United States,‚Äù said Jie Zhao, a professor at the China Executive Leadership Academy Pudong, which trains senior civil servants in Shanghai. ‚ÄúThey do not understand Trump, do not understand his team and do not understand the source of his policies.‚Äù Part of the problem is that the leadership‚Äôs usual contacts in the United States ‚Äî often establishment figures with backgrounds in international finance and diplomacy ‚Äî have been largely sidelined by Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúThe people with whom Chinese officials are familiar in Washington are mainly the enemies of Trump,‚Äù said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ‚ÄúTrump hates those people.‚Äù Beijing has also been frustrated as potential allies have fallen out of favor, including Gary D. Cohn, the chief economic adviser who counseled against tariffs but resigned last month, and Mr. Trump‚Äôs son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who appears to have stepped back on the issue because of his family‚Äôs business interests in China. Looking for answers, Vice President Wang has met instead in recent weeks with three former Treasury secretaries ‚Äî Timothy Geithner, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lawrence H. Summers ‚Äî as well as Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, and William S. Cohen, the former defense secretary. Business leaders who have met with Chinese leaders in the same period include Timothy D. Cook of Apple, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs. ‚ÄúThey ask, ‚ÄòWho can we talk to?‚Äô‚Äù said David M. Lampton, the scholar who has recently hosted five Chinese officials. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see a stable structure.‚Äù But Professor Lampton, of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, added that despite their frustration, the Chinese seemed satisfied that they can ‚Äúoutlast a U.S. administration that alienates its allies, erodes its own political base and has a public with a low threshold for pain.‚Äù There are vague hints of disagreement in Beijing over how to respond to Mr. Trump‚Äôs trade threats. Some in the elite have emphasized the potential impact of a trade war on the Chinese economy and urged negotiations, while others have argued that the dispute is part of a broader effort to thwart China‚Äôs rise ‚Äî and that Beijing must respond accordingly. ‚ÄúOn the trade war issue, the hawkish atmosphere in China is quite strong right now,‚Äù said Chen Jieren, a political commentator in Beijing. Although the tariffs that Mr. Trump has enacted thus far hit only a small segment of China‚Äôs steel and aluminum sector, the pain of a proposed additional set would be spread across manufacturers of more than 1,300 goods. Given the party‚Äôs tight control of the media, there has been no outcry against Mr. Xi‚Äôs policies like that by some American business leaders against Mr. Trump‚Äôs tariffs. It helps that no single sector or region in China stands out as especially vulnerable, though the aerospace industry could be stung and Chinese automakers eyeing exports to the United States would be disrupted. The mood at a conference in the southern city of Boao this week that brought together Chinese business leaders was upbeat after Mr. Xi addressed the gathering and urged ‚Äúdialogue rather than confrontation.‚Äù But speaking at the conference, Fan Gang, the director of China‚Äôs National Economic Research Institute, warned of ‚Äúsystematic risk‚Äù to manufacturing supply chains. And Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, suggested that a trade war could destroy 10 million jobs. One sensitive question in Beijing is the fate of the Made in China 2025 plan, which has been the focus of the Trump administration‚Äôs complaints. The program would provide subsidies and loans to help Chinese firms acquire foreign competitors, develop advanced technologies and dominate key sectors such as alternative energy, robotics, telecom and artificial intelligence. The military and security apparatus, and the industries close to them, regard the program as essential to China‚Äôs strategic ambitions. But discerning the attitude of China‚Äôs economic policymakers is more difficult, and not simply because it would be politically taboo to back away from a plan that Mr. Xi has blessed. Premier Li Keqiang, for example, has tended to take more conciliatory positions in trade disputes than colleagues in the leadership who favor asserting China‚Äôs clout as a global power. But Mr. Li also leads a cluster of government ministers who are the main architects and advocates of the Made in China 2025 program. They include Miao Wei, the minister of industry and information technology, and Wang Zhigang, the minister of science and technology. Like Mr. Li, both grew up in central China‚Äôs impoverished Anhui Province and favor an extensive role for the state in upgrading Chinese industries, acquaintances said. On the other hand, the policymakers closest to Mr. Xi ‚Äî men with finance backgrounds including Mr. Liu and Vice President Wang ‚Äî are more interested in seeking geopolitical parity with the United States and less enthusiastic about industrial policy in general. They worry that state intervention may distort markets and exacerbate the problems of China‚Äôs already debt-laden financial system, people who know them said. Yet such concerns have not translated into a willingness to retreat on the Made in China 2025 program in the face of Mr. Trump‚Äôs threats. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think China is willing to compromise Made in China 2025,‚Äù said Da Wei, a professor at the University of International Relations in Beijing. ‚ÄúThis is the core of the competition.‚Äù Mr. Xi has charted a moderate course so far, retaliating in equal measure when the Trump administration has imposed tariffs, while urging that the dispute be resolved through negotiation. But talks have stalled since Chinese officials rejected American demands that Made in China 2025 be rolled back. A Chinese spokesman said on Thursday that no actual trade negotiations were underway.

Business,"Advertisement By KEITH BRADSHERAPRIL 30, 2018  BEIJING ‚Äî Staking an assertive negotiating stance, China says it will refuse to discuss President Trump‚Äôs two toughest trade demands when American officials arrive in Beijing this week, potentially derailing the high-level talks. The Chinese government is publicly calling for flexibility on both sides. But senior Beijing officials do not plan to discuss the two biggest requests that the Trump administration has made over the past several months, according to people involved in Chinese policymaking. Those include a mandatory $100 billion cut in America‚Äôs $375 billion annual trade deficit with China and curbs on Beijing‚Äôs $300 billion plan to bankroll the country‚Äôs industrial upgrade into advanced technologies like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, electric cars and commercial aircraft. The reason: Beijing feels its economy has become big enough and resilient enough to stand up to the United States. [On other trade fronts, even American allies aren‚Äôt sure what the Trump administration plans. Read more about their concerns.] A half-dozen senior Chinese officials and two dozen influential advisers laid out the Chinese government‚Äôs position in detail during a three-day seminar that ended here late Monday morning. The officials and most of the advisers at the seminar gave an overview of China‚Äôs economic policies, including an in-depth review of the country‚Äôs trade policy, to make sure China‚Äôs stance would be known overseas. All of the officials and most of the advisers at the seminar insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. Advertisement It is not clear what will happen when the two sides sit down this week or whether either will find a reason to waver. Still, the Chinese and American positions are so far apart that China‚Äôs leaders are skeptical the two sides can find common ground by the end of this week. They are already raising the possibility that Chinese officials may fly to Washington a month from now for further talks. Advertisement ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect a comprehensive deal whatsoever,‚Äù said Ruan Zongze, the executive vice president of the China Institute of International Studies, which is the policy research arm of China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry. ‚ÄúI think there is a lot of game playing here.‚Äù Beijing is frustrated with Mr. Trump‚Äôs threats to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods and dismayed by suggestions in the West that China has a weak bargaining position. Chinese officials think the country‚Äôs one-party political system and President Xi Jinping‚Äôs enduring grip on power ‚Äî particularly after the repeal of presidential term limits in March ‚Äî mean that China can outlast the United States and Mr. Trump in any trade quarrel. The Chinese government believes Mr. Trump‚Äôs background as a businessman means that at some point he will agree to a deal. Seminar participants also reaffirmed previous Chinese trade policy offers to further open the country‚Äôs financial and automotive sectors, though not in ways that would impact China‚Äôs industrial modernization program, called Made in China 2025. They also suggested that China would be willing to tighten its intellectual property rules so as to foster innovation within China as well as protect foreign technologies from counterfeiting and other illegal copying. China is insisting that the parameters of any negotiations be limited, and that the tariff threat be removed before a final deal can be struck. Chinese officials have reached out to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has reacted positively to China‚Äôs overtures in the auto and financial sectors. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive who will be on the Trump administration‚Äôs team in Beijing later this week, has sought to calm investors worried that the rhetoric between Washington and Beijing could break out into a full-blown trade war.                  American companies want a level playing field with their Chinese counterparts. China wants to build its industries into sophisticated global competitors. This week, both countries demonstrated a willingness to escalate trade tensions to defend their positions.             China‚Äôs position is that the bilateral trade imbalance arises from differences in savings rates. Households in China save roughly two-fifths of their income. Americans, on average, save almost nothing. So money from China tends to flow to the United States, buying factories, technology companies, real estate and more, and Americans in turn spend much of that money to buy goods from China. Many economists in the United States, including some at the Treasury, share that view. By contrast, many trade lawyers, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and Mr. Trump contend that the trade deficit stems to a large extent from unfair practices, including cheap loans by state-controlled banks to exporters. Advertisement China is ready to discuss shrinking the $375 billion annual trade deficit. But it wants to do so by buying more high-tech American goods. Washington has long blocked such deals because of concerns that they may have military value. China is also willing to buy more oil, natural gas, coal and other goods from the United States, and to help finance the extra pipelines and other infrastructure that would be needed to move them to China. A senior Chinese government official said that Beijing is unwilling to negotiate with the United States on any curbs on Made in China 2025, which includes large-scale government assistance to favored industries in advanced-technology manufacturing. China perceives the American demands as an attempt to stop China‚Äôs economic development and technological progress, the senior Chinese official said.

Germany and other countries also have industrial policies, and the United States has not objected to them, he added. American and European officials have argued that those policies elsewhere are much narrower and less ambitious. Other advisers and officials said that the United States had misunderstood the Made in China 2025 industrial policy. They expressed hope that it might be possible to resolve differences by explaining the program better and making very small tweaks to it ‚Äî a stance that still may not appease the Trump administration. The Chinese government is not simply throwing money, land and other resources to favored industries like robotics, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and aircraft manufacturing, they said. China is engaged instead, they contended, in a carefully thought-out program that measures potential profits for each dollar of investment. So China‚Äôs program bears some resemblance, they said, to private sector investment programs in the West. One subject was repeatedly and conspicuously avoided by all officials throughout the seminar, even when advisers occasionally speculated about it: whether China might someday try to link trade disputes to national security issues. China has been deeply involved in international pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, an issue of high importance to the Trump administration. Beijing also wants to someday assert control of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade territory. Tsinghua University‚Äôs new Academic Center for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking organized the seminar, which was held at Tsinghua and two other venues in western Beijing. President Xi graduated from Tsinghua, which is in Beijing and is China‚Äôs top university, and he has filled much of the senior ranks of his government with Tsinghua professors and graduates. In some respects, the hard stance struck by Chinese officials reflects a hardening of public attitudes in China. Advertisement In mid-April, the United States barred American companies from selling their wares to a Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE. The move is seen as potentially crippling to the Chinese company, which needs American chips and software to power the smartphones and equipment it sells around the world. Washington officials cited ZTE‚Äôs repeated violations of sanctions against Iran and North Korea, but many in China saw it as a reminder by the United States that sizable sectors of the Chinese economy still rely on American-made goods. Much of the Made in China 2025 policy is aimed at reducing that dependence. The ZTE case ‚Äúhas changed a lot of Chinese people‚Äôs opinion,‚Äù said Mr. Ruan, of the China Institute of International Studies. ‚ÄúIn the past, people saw us as interdependent.‚Äù Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher.

Politics,"Advertisement By MATTHEW ROSENBERGMARCH 21, 2018  John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, saw signs of Russian election meddling. Are his suggestive public statements signs that he knows information that he can‚Äôt divulge? WASHINGTON ‚Äî John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said Wednesday that he thought Russia may have some kind of compromising information on President Trump, setting off furious speculation about whether the former spy chief was basing that assertion on inside information. In an appearance on Wednesday on MSNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMorning Joe,‚Äù Mr. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director from 2013 to 2017, speculated that Russians ‚Äúmay have something on him personally‚Äù when he was asked if he thought Mr. Trump was afraid of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. ‚ÄúThe Russians, I think, have had long experience with Mr. Trump, and may have things that they could expose,‚Äù he added. Mr. Brennan was running the C.I.A. when a salacious dossier surfaced in 2016 that claimed the Russians had compromising information on Mr. Trump. If there were any current or former American officials who might know if there was truth behind the allegations in the dossier, Mr. Brennan would most likely be one of them. And his comments came the day after a phone call Mr. Trump made to Mr. Putin congratulating him for winning an election raised new questions about the president‚Äôs relationship with Russia. Advertisement As C.I.A. director, Mr. Brennan was never known as particularly chatty around the news media or in public. And since leaving office, Mr. Brennan has taken to starting conversations with journalists by telling them, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be an anonymous source for any stories.‚Äù Advertisement But last weekend, Mr. Brennan ‚Äî in response to Mr. Trump‚Äôs praise for the firing of the former deputy director of the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe ‚Äî issued a remarkable condemnation of the president. ‚ÄúWhen the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,‚Äù Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter. Mr. Brennan‚Äôs pointed criticism of Mr. Trump on MSNBC and on Twitter was hardly unique. From the outset of the Trump presidency, a litany of retired intelligence officials ‚Äî the kind of people who have traditionally shied away from criticizing presidents, even in retirement ‚Äî have come forward to criticize Mr. Trump. The former officials have included those like Mr. Brennan who served under Democrats and others who served under Republicans, such as Michael Hayden, who ran both the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency under President George W. Bush. Nearly all insist they have no desire to wade into partisan politics, but are genuinely alarmed by what they see as Mr. Trump‚Äôs fundamental disregard for the rule of law and his impetuous approach to the nation‚Äôs security. So Mr. Brennan‚Äôs latest accusations on Wednesday quickly became fodder for news articles, social media conspiracy theories and hours of speculation on cable news channels. And his remarks seemed to go beyond what he had said publicly in January 2017, five days before he stepped down as C.I.A. director, when he had said the dossier was ‚Äúunsubstantiated‚Äù and his criticism of Mr. Trump was relatively mild.

But later in the day on Wednesday, Mr. Brennan explained that his comments were speculation based on Mr. Trump‚Äôs words and deeds, as well as how Mr. Putin‚Äôs government has operated at home and abroad ‚Äî but not on any inside knowledge. ‚ÄúI do not know if the Russians have something on Donald Trump that they could use as blackmail,‚Äù he said in a written response to questions from The New York Times. ‚ÄúWhen asked the question, I have pointed out the perplexing submissiveness of Mr. Trump toward Mr. Putin ‚Äî despite continued evidence of malign Russian activities,‚Äù Mr. Brennan added. ‚ÄúI do not know why he refuses to call out Russia; that is a question that can only be answered by Mr. Trump.‚Äù Advertisement Along with Mr. Brennan, who is a paid contributor to NBC and MSNBC, other retired officials with contributor deals included James Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Steven L.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Asia and Australia Edition By Charles McDermid Good morning.  Here‚Äôs what you need to know: ‚Ä¢ President Trump formally announced the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, saying it would advance the peace process. Mr. Trump asserted that the U.S. would remain a neutral broker in the effort, but offered little solace to the Palestinians. But the decision has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, and Pope Francis and China joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could stir unrest across the region. The leader of Hamas called it ‚Äúan unaccountable gamble.‚Äù This video explains why Jerusalem is so contested.

Technology," FEB. 9, 2018   Major companies have been forced to rethink how they advertise online after coming under fire when their digital ads appeared next to racist or fake-news content.  Major companies have been forced to rethink how they advertise online after coming under fire when their digital ads appeared next to racist or fake-news content. By Sapna Maheshwari FEB. 14, 2018 For advertisers, one of the internet‚Äôs great promises has been the ability to automatically target people based on their interests and demographics, with little regard to the websites they are visiting. But these days, major brands have been forced to rethink how they advertise online. Companies from Kellogg to AT&T have come under fire for inadvertently funding bigotry, hate speech and misinformation, often because they were using automated ad technology to reach groups of people across a vast number of sites and videos. The internet was born in text. Now, video and audio are ascendant, writing is being left behind, and everything will be different. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 I‚Äôll make this short: The thing you‚Äôre doing now, reading prose on a screen, is going out of fashion. We‚Äôre taking stock of the internet right now, with writers who cover the digital world cataloging some of the most consequential currents shaping it. If you probe those currents and look ahead to the coming year online, one truth becomes clear. The defining narrative of our online moment concerns the decline of text, and the exploding reach and power of audio and video. The distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan have closed. Now simple, guttural digital messages, often with multimedia, are big in politics. By Nellie Bowles FEB. 14, 2018 Political memes have gone mainstream as the distance between the White House and subcultures like 4Chan has closed. President Trump has frequently retweeted his fans‚Äô meme work, #MeToo jumped from social media to every workplace, and political campaigns started to invest in the form more seriously. The political meme ‚Äî text over an image, sometimes short videos or digital clip art meant to spread and be imitated ‚Äî is often a guttural, simple message couched in humor, like the doctored video from September of Hillary Clinton being hit with his golf ball. There are now more ways to tell if your tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because of the ratio. By Mike Isaac FEB. 14, 2018 It‚Äôs easy to tell when you‚Äôve nailed a good tweet ‚Äî just watch the likes and retweets pile up as the post goes viral. Now there are also more ways to tell if a tweet was bad. That‚Äôs because a new barometer for Twitter blahness has taken hold: the ratio. It‚Äôs harder to ignore harassment, or retaliate against accusers, when reports are bolstered by the stories of many others and the public is watching. By Claire Cain Miller FEB. 14, 2018 Susan Fowler had tried going to human resources. She had tried going to her managers. She had tried transferring departments. But nothing changed. The sexual and sexist comments she received as an engineer at Uber kept coming. So she went online and wrote a 3,000-word blog post exposing the behavior. The pioneers of social media have begun grumbling that their technology might be irresistible. But they have few ideas about how to tame the beast they built. By Farhad Manjoo FEB. 14, 2018 Your phone buzzes. A message, an Instagram post, a tweet ‚Äî some bit of digital effluvia has come in, and it‚Äôs right there, promising a brief but necessary hit of connection. All you have to do is look. But, just as an experiment, how long can you resist looking? A minute? Two? If you make it that long, how do you start to feel? Can you concentrate? Does your mind wander at what you‚Äôre missing? And if you give in ‚Äî as you surely will, as you probably do many times a day ‚Äî how do you feel about yourself? Instead of perfectly polishing their feeds, photographers and brands are now showing what women, in particular, actually look like. By Amanda Hess FEB. 14, 2018 For all the talk about the internet‚Äôs power to democratize the media, Instagram can present an awfully traditional picture of what a woman is supposed to be. The images that rise on the platform are a hellscape of white feminine conformity, with top influencers sporting the same matte lips and contoured cheeks, their bodies whittled and waxed and contorted into the same poses. (Hey, @kyliejenner.) But perfectly polished Instagram feeds have now given way to real ones, in which women in particular are showing what they actually look like. And because they have demanded to be seen, brands have taken notice, too. Advertisement "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By Victor Mather The Warriors-Cavaliers matchup in Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals wasn‚Äôt much of a contest. But what about Rihanna vs. Kevin Durant? Or Rihanna vs. Eddy Cue, the head of Apple Music? Rihanna, the pop sensation, is a huge LeBron James and Cavaliers fan and was sitting in the expensive seats for the game in Oakland. She was an active trash talker, and became a flash point for Warriors hecklers, but seemed far from bothered by it. Rihanna bows down to LeBron, then hits a dab on a Warriors fan that told her to sit down. üòÇ pic.twitter.com/zXhjSqueF3 Another incident that stirred an online reaction came when a fan stood up and seemingly shouted at Rihanna to sit down. Numerous commenters declared they found his behavior disrespectful. Internet sleuths soon identified the man: Cue, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president for internet software and services, who is a die-hard Warriors fan. Durant watched the election results last November at Cue‚Äôs house along with Tim Cook, Apple‚Äôs CEO, and pop star Pharrell Williams. Calls for boycotts of Apple Music quickly emerged. Eileen Carey, the CEO of the software company Glassbreakers, said she would be canceling her subscription. Cue issued a rare tweet to deny he was yelling at Rihanna, instead saying that the target was someone named ‚ÄúMarissa.‚Äù At one point, Rihanna seemed to yell ‚Äúbrick‚Äù when Kevin Durant of the Warriors was taking a free throw. Durant turned to look in her direction after making the shot. Later, after sinking a 3-pointer, he turned around and stared in her direction again. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even remember,‚Äù Durant said when asked about it after the game. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get in that trap,‚Äù cautioned Stephen Curry, sitting next to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cool, have fun with that,‚Äù Durant said, dismissing the question. Rihanna tends to get attention wherever she goes, even from those whose eyes are supposed to be elsewhere. After a thunderous James dunk, TV commentator Jeff Van Gundy offered this analysis: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about this, but Rihanna just walked in front of me. Are you kidding me?‚Äù His co-announcer Mike Breen jocularly admonished him to ‚ÄúStay in the game.‚Äù Though her team lost handily, Rihanna was sanguine after the game. A camera picked her up shrugging ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù as she left the arena. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor By Ben Smith Exactly one year ago BuzzFeed published what‚Äôs now known simply as ‚Äúthe dossier‚Äù: a set of reports put together by a former British intelligence officer named Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential campaign. The 35-page dossier suggested that the Russian government had both compromised and colluded with President-elect Donald Trump. Our choice to publish the dossier was greeted by outrage from two sources. Journalistic traditionalists didn‚Äôt like the idea of sharing an unfiltered, unverified document with the public, whatever the caveats and context. NBC‚Äôs Chuck Todd told me on air, ‚ÄúYou just published fake news.‚Äù Mr. Trump agreed. He described CNN‚Äôs reporting on the dossier as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and called BuzzFeed a ‚Äúfailing pile of garbage.‚Äù But a year of government inquiries and blockbuster journalism has made clear that the dossier is unquestionably real news. That‚Äôs a fact that has been tacitly acknowledged even by those who opposed our decision to publish. It has helped journalists explain to their audience the investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election. And Mr. Trump and his allies have seized on the dossier in their efforts to discredit the special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller. Without the dossier, Americans would have found it difficult to understand the actions of their elected representatives and government officials. Their posture toward Mr. Trump was, we now know even more comprehensively than we did in January 2017, shaped by Mr. Steele‚Äôs report. The Russia investigation, meanwhile, didn‚Äôt turn out to be some minor side story but instead the central challenge to Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidency. When we published the dossier, we knew a lot: We knew that it had been written by the former head of the Russia desk at Britain‚Äôs main foreign intelligence agency, a man whose job had made him a leading source on Russian espionage. We knew that key members of the Senate ‚Äî Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat, and John McCain, the Arizona Republican ‚Äî had acted on its contents. We had also learned that intelligence officials had briefed President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump on the dossier, and that the F.B.I. was already looking into it. We didn‚Äôt discount the arguments against publishing salacious allegations ‚Äî which reporters do all the time in covering lawsuits, internal investigations or reports like Mr. Steele‚Äôs. And we understand why President Trump‚Äôs supporters remain furious at the airing of a disturbingly vivid unproven allegation about encounters with prostitutes. But we never bought the notion, made by the traditionalists, that a main threat to journalism is that journalists might be too transparent with their audience. Keeping the reporting process wrapped in mystery only helps those who oppose the free press. This is why The New York Times posts leaked audio recordings, and why news organizations routinely publish raw court documents underlying their articles. We strongly believed that publishing the disputed document whose existence we and others were reporting was in the public interest. Since we published, the public has learned a great deal more about how seriously the F.B.I. took the dossier. The F.B.I., CNN reported, used the dossier to justify its effort to spy on an American citizen, and reimbursed Mr. Steele for some of his expenses. The BBC reported that the dossier was a ‚Äúroad map‚Äù to the F.B.I. investigation. Fox News recently reported that a top Department of Justice official met with Mr. Steele during the 2016 campaign. And on Tuesday, the public was given a glimpse, in the release of secret testimony, into the fierce battle between Senate Democrats and Republicans over the dossier and how the F.B.I. made use of it during the 2016 campaign. As the seriousness of the Russia investigation has become clearer, the pro-Trump line has shifted from dismissing the dossier to stressing its role in the investigation: The dossier, some of Mr. Trump‚Äôs defenders now say, played too big a part, given that a portion of Mr. Steele‚Äôs funding came from political enemies of Mr. Trump, including the Democratic National Committee. ‚ÄúAre we in the midst of a major criminal investigation against the president of the United States as a result of this dodgy dossier?‚Äù asked Tom Fitton, a Trump ally, on ‚ÄúFox & Friends‚Äù recently. While Mr. Trump‚Äôs camp dismiss the dossier as malicious fiction or pure political opportunism, some elements have been corroborated. For example, that the Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort hid payments for his work in Ukraine, as federal authorities have alleged; that the Russian diplomat Mikhail Kalugin was withdrawn suddenly from the United States; and that Mr. Trump sought, but never consummated, business deals in Russia. Mr. Steele also reported, in pages submitted just 11 days after a Russian lawyer reportedly promised Mr. Trump‚Äôs aides negative information on Hillary Clinton during a meeting in Trump Tower, that ‚Äúthe Kremlin had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne large portion of the dossier is crystal-clear, certain, consistent and corroborated,‚Äù a C.I.A. veteran, John Sipher, wrote recently. ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs goal all along has been to do damage to America and our leadership role in the world.‚Äù For all these reasons, the chorus of criticism of our decision to publish has faded. I haven‚Äôt had a single person approach me to say, ‚ÄúI wish I hadn‚Äôt read the dossier, and wish I had less insight into the forces at play in America.‚Äù Do you feel that way? Does anyone?

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman OK, Trump has gone ahead with steel and aluminum tariffs, with an exemption for Canada and Mexico if they renegotiate NAFTA (which seems to make nonsense of the supposed national security rationale, but whatever).

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman Paul Krugman took questions from readers about trade after President Trump‚Äôs announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Here are his answers to some of the hundreds of questions he received. ‚Äî By the Editors 1. Literally every small consumer item I buy is made in China. Please explain how this came to be (and whether you think we can or should take steps to change it). 2. Should all manufacturing jobs flow to the lowest-cost, lowest-wage environments, regardless of working conditions or environmental impacts? If not, how can a free-trade system prevent this? 3. The government of China is subsidizing the growth of its electric car industry by providing very significant subsidies (about one-third of cost) to consumers. This subsidy will allow the industry to scale up much more quickly and produce electric cars cheaper than anyone else. In a free-trade world, is this good planning, or cheating? ‚Äî Nick Van Kleeck, Tucson, Ariz. Paul Krugman: 1. It‚Äôs partly a sort of optical illusion. China dominates assembly of many goods thanks to a combination of still-low wages and an extensive industrial ‚Äúecology‚Äù of supporting firms. But much of the value of the good actually comes from elsewhere. For example, iPhones are ‚Äúmade‚Äù in China, but China only accounts for less than 4 percent of their price. 2. Not entirely ‚Äî there‚Äôs some room for insisting on basic working conditions and environmental rules. But not too much. Consider Bangladesh: all it really has is a large labor force, with fairly low productivity. Low wages are the only way they can sell on world markets. If we insist that they follow first-world rules, we‚Äôre basically telling them to go starve. 3. It‚Äôs tricky. Subsidizing consumers is O.K. under the rules, while subsidizing producers isn‚Äôt. If the U.S. offered tax breaks for electric cars, it would be perfectly legal under W.T.O. rules. The trouble is that given Chinese reality, you‚Äôre not going to see a lot of foreign electric cars sold there. But as these things go, it‚Äôs not a particularly egregious example. I remember in undergraduate school (1964) studying President Kennedy‚Äôs Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This was in a political economics class. What was the significance of this act and was it bipartisan? Also, recommend some readings on political economics. ‚Äî Morgan Rauch, Houston, Tex. PK: It was bipartisan, and really a continuation of the process of reciprocal trade liberalization that began in 1934 under F.D.R. What changed under the ‚ÄúKennedy Round‚Äù was that as easy targets for trade deals ran out, we shifted to internationally agreed formulas: cut all tariffs by X percent, then negotiate the exemptions. But most of the heavy lifting in tariff reduction had already happened. My question: How will American steel workers fare as a result of this tariff? I heard the head of a steel workers union on NPR welcome this tariff and he sounded as if their prayers have been answered! ‚Äî James C., Brooklyn PK: We will gain a few jobs in steel. But we‚Äôll lose jobs in lots of other, ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù industries like autos. Most studies of the 2002 steel tariffs say that they cost jobs on net. So yes, steel workers get a little, but at what cost to other workers? I live very near a HUGE rusted-out steel plant, Bethlehem Steel in Steelton, Pa. I came here 44 years ago and it had already started its long sad road to its present obsolescence. Trump described this phenomenon in his rollout. He then had union workers talk about the production reductions to 20 percent from the heyday of domestic steel production. What source of funding could possibly come in and want to turn this 3.5-mile row of rusted barned eyesore around? Billions of dollars of investment would be necessary. The ideas of ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù seem to be based in recreating the economy of the ‚Äô50s, ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s. This and the return of coal to the high ridges of Pennsylvania seem a distant memory. Is revitalization of these old industries even a possibility? Aren‚Äôt the jobs from the Rust Belt too expensive to get back? Or would another community‚Äôs landscape be blighted instead? ‚Äî CC, New Cumberland, Pa.  PK: There‚Äôs no way to bring back all those steel plants and steel jobs, even if we stopped all imports. Partly that‚Äôs because a modern economy doesn‚Äôt use that much steel, partly because we can produce steel using many fewer workers, partly because old-fashioned open-hearth plants have been replaced by mini-mills that use scrap metal and aren‚Äôt in the same places. So this is all a fantasy. What is your critique of the anti-trade argument made by the Warren-Sanders wing of the Democratic Party: that free trade has been bad for the (proverbial) American worker and has been a significant contributor to America‚Äôs rising income and wealth inequality? Is the answer simply that the benefits of free trade ‚Äî lower prices generally ‚Äî are diffuse and therefore underappreciated, whereas the costs ‚Äî worker dislocation in particular sectors ‚Äî are concentrated and thus easier to highlight? How much of America‚Äôs increase in income inequality over the past half-century do you attribute to free trade? Thank you for addressing this. ‚Äî JG in CT, Greenwich, Conn.  How should we deal with the deindustrialization and loss of community that free trade has been causing? If tariffs are not the answer, what policies would you recommend? ‚Äî L Marcus, New York PK: There‚Äôs some truth to the argument that growing trade has contributed to rising inequality; if imports of manufactures from developing countries were still as low as they were in, say, 1970, real wages of blue-collar workers would probably be a few percent higher than they are. But the level of protectionism it would take to get those few percent back would have lots of ugly side consequences. If we want to help U.D. workers ‚Äî and we do ‚Äî there are better ways. You may remember Bernie Sanders using Denmark as an example. It‚Äôs a good one: much better wages, a much stronger social safety net, a mostly unionized work force. But Denmark is as open to world trade as we are. It‚Äôs domestic policies ‚Äî from taxing and spending decisions to pro-labor policies in the service sector ‚Äî that make the difference. Universal health care and the right to organize matter a lot more for workers than trade policy. Why does the president of the United States have the authority to make decisions (such as imposing tariffs) that have significant impacts on the economy, trade, relationships with allies, etc. ‚Äî with impunity, and with no input from Congress? What path should Congress be taking to restrict his powers.‚Äî Ricky, Saint Paul, Minn. PK: Actually, Congress voluntarily limited its own role, to protect itself from special-interest politics: it votes big trade deals up or down on a single vote, then stays out of it. But given the realities of trade tensions, the system needs some ‚Äúescape valves‚Äù ‚Äî ways to provide temporary relief in hard cases. That‚Äôs why the president has certain ways he can impose tariffs: if there‚Äôs a finding that an industry has been injured by an import surge, if national security is at stake, if foreigners pursue unfair practices. However, these powers aren‚Äôt supposed to be used arbitrarily: there‚Äôs supposed to be an independent study of the issue, and the president acts on the basis of that study. What‚Äôs happening with Trump is an abuse of the process: the Commerce Department came up with an obviously bogus national security rationale for tariffs Trump wanted to impose for other reasons. So we have a process that gives presidents some discretion, for pretty good reasons ‚Äî but one that assumes that said presidents will act honestly and responsibly. It falls apart when you‚Äôre dealing with someone like Trump. Will we be able to undo this after this administration is voted out? Or does this have far too many long-term effects? ‚Äî Stephanie Minister, Hingham, Mass. PK: President Oprah Winfrey, or whoever, can undo these tariffs with a stroke of the pen. However, we might get into a full-scale trade war before that happens, and in any case the U.S. has already lost its reputation as a reliable negotiating partner. My question is: What role does free trade play in income inequality, and the concentration of wealth in a global economy?  I have little doubt that trade creates value. On average everyone ends up wealthier with free trade ‚Äî better allocation of resources. Rarely do I see the unequal distribution of the value created by trade addressed. Sure, blue-collar workers all enjoy lower prices on apparel at Walmart with low-cost textiles from China, but some worker lost a $25/hour job in a U.S. textile mill, and the Walmart saving doesn‚Äôt offset the $15/hour job for that displaced worker. The downside of free trade is concentrated onto a relatively small group of people. I also believe that financiers and the capital class keep a large part of the savings when U.S. jobs are sent offshore, and individual workers with limited geographical scope pay a price. To me the question isn‚Äôt IF trade creates wealth, but for whom is the wealth created. ‚Äî Tom Stoltz, Detroit PK: There‚Äôs been a lot of work on this question over the years. Back in 1995 I estimated that trade widened the gap between college and non-college workers by 3 percent, and that number has surely risen since, though maybe only a couple of points. By the way, the downside affects a lot of people, not just a small group. We also think that the surge in imports between 2000 and 2007 displaced something like a million workers. Most of those workers eventually found other jobs, but many faced wage cuts and some communities got hurt badly. So this isn‚Äôt a subject economists have been ignoring. You just want to ask what‚Äôs the best way to help workers, and tariffs are rarely the answer. Is a perennial (and rising) trade deficit desirable and even sustainable in the very long run? Much of our debt is now owned by other countries (see China and Japan for example). Are we not giving away ownership of our of national wealth to our trading partners? I am in favor of free trade but I was always puzzled by the decades-long rising trade deficit. Germany, for example, a Western democracy, manages to have a trade surplus (with the help of the euro of course, but they still make goods people want even outside the eurozone). I have read explanations that the privilege of having a reserve currency has a price, which is maintaining trade surpluses, and this in turn allows for lower interest rates and higher growth. Sounds interesting but still can we make the case that the rising debt is sustainable for the long run? What is your view? ‚Äî Costa Glaretas  PK: Basically, we have persistent trade deficits because we have low savings and remain an attractive place for foreigners to invest. And as a result, the U.S., which was a creditor country before we began running persistent deficits since 1980, is now a net debtor. But you want to keep some perspective. Our ‚Äúnet international investment position‚Äù ‚Äî overseas assets less liabilities ‚Äî is about -45 percent of G.D.P., which isn‚Äôt that big a number, all things considered. For example, it‚Äôs less than 10 percent of our national wealth. And the idea that this gives foreigners a lot of power over America has it backward. On the contrary, in a way it makes them our hostages: China has a lot of money tied up in America. Suppose they tried to pull it out: the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar, which would be good for U.S. manufacturing and inflict a capital loss on our creditors. Lot of things worry me; our foreign debt, not so much. Perhaps something else is going on. For example, steel and aluminum are key industries in Pittsburgh (home of Alcoa). Could the need to stop a string of Democratic midterm victories play a role in the timing and choice of targets for these tariffs? ‚Äî Peter, San Mateo, Calif. PK: Quite possibly. We know that‚Äôs why Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002. But I think this is mostly Trump trying to look tough. At a guess, Stormy Daniels had a bigger impact than PA-18. Clearly, global trade is too complicated for Donald Trump to fathom. But Paul Krugman? No. Not too complicated. So: pretend you are in his position, but with your knowledge and insight. What would you do regarding trade? Top three plays/passes. ‚Äî Jack, Nashville PK: Basically, U.S. trade policy is O.K. The old days of lots of manufacturing jobs aren‚Äôt coming back whatever we do, and trying to save a few of them by ripping up trade rules would have lots of nasty side effects. I was against TPP, but not because I want a return to protectionism: the trouble with TPP was that it wasn‚Äôt about trade at all, it was mainly about intellectual property (e.g. pharma patents) and dispute settlement (giving corporations more power). What we need is a renewed commitment to universal health care, much more investment in infrastructure, policies to help families and a return to policies that empower unions, especially in the service sector. Defining trade as the problem is just a way to duck real solutions. What are the worst-case repercussions of these tariffs when our trade partners retaliate? ‚Äî Donald Ferruzzi, Centereach, N.Y. PK: In the short run, there‚Äôs a huge amount of disruption: we‚Äôd eventually gain jobs in import-competing industries, but we‚Äôd immediately lose a lot of jobs both in export sectors (including farming) and in industries that are currently part of global supply chains, like autos and electronics. So we‚Äôd be talking about millions of immediate losers, even if some would eventually gain. In the longer run, the economy would just be less efficient: instead of concentrating on stuff we‚Äôre especially good at, we‚Äôd be doing a lot of labor-intensive stuff for ourselves. I haven‚Äôt seen a good estimate of just how much poorer, but it would surely be worse than Brexit, which typical estimates say will make Britain about 2 percent poorer. We‚Äôre not talking the end of the world or even a major depression here. Just a big short-term mess and a longer-term drag on economic growth. What part do disparate wages and benefits paid to workers by the various trading nations play in trade policy, if any? If Country A can, because of low wages, produce a product at half or less the cost of Country B, how can trade, without tariffs, ever be fair? ‚Äî abigail49, Ga. PK: What you need to ask is why wages are so much lower in some countries than they are here. The answer is that they have much lower overall productivity ‚Äî globally, the relationship between productivity and average wages is pretty close to one-for-one. So when you look at low-wage countries, they have a big cost advantage in sectors like clothing where their productivity isn‚Äôt too much lower than ours, but a big cost disadvantage in higher-tech sectors. Remember, Germany, which runs the world‚Äôs biggest trade surplus, actually pays substantially higher wages than we do. Just a thought from a U.S. contractor: At Home Depot and Lowe‚Äôs it‚Äôs essentially impossible to find a steel hand tool (hammer, saw, chisel, screwdriver, etc.) or electric tool that is NOT made in China, Taiwan or Mexico. In addition, the quality of that foreign steel is clearly inferior, subject to fast oxidation (rusting) or actual fracture. Although the few American-made tools available are somewhat more expensive, those of us who want something to last buy American ‚Äî IF you can find it. It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs that we can‚Äôt compete with the imports even though our production quality is far superior to foreign steel. Will the tariffs fix this? No clue. ‚Äî LJM, Cape Cod, Mass. PK: If people are buying inferior foreign products, isn‚Äôt that their choice? Maybe they care more about low prices than quality. It‚Äôs kind of like buying fresh but expensive local produce: I prefer it, but I‚Äôm affluent enough to make that choice. Many people aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôm interested in the analysis of the mechanics of such decisions worldwide, especially for third world economies, rather than the important political conflicts among nations that you mentioned in your excellent article. ‚Äî Wail Fahmi Bedawi PK: It all depends on how widespread the trade conflict gets. I often focus on the example of Bangladesh, where people used to predict mass deaths from starvation due to overpopulation, but it‚Äôs currently keeping its head above water and even achieving significant growth (from a very low base) thanks to open world markets that let it export lots of clothing. If we do have a full-scale trade war, the impact on places like Bangladesh will be devastating if not deadly. How much damage should we expect these tariffs to do to the economy and the markets? Will they affect some regions of the U.S. more than others? I‚Äôm a public employee and I‚Äôm wondering about state tax receipts. ‚Äî UCB Parent, Calif.  PK: By themselves, the steel and aluminum tariffs aren‚Äôt that big a deal. Consumers won‚Äôt notice them much; some auto plants, etc., that might have opened will be canceled, but I don‚Äôt expect to see any existing plants closed. Revenue effects will also be small. But if this turns into tit-for-tat, with Europe retaliating and Trump retaliating back, who knows? Questions: 1) How will the tariffs affect E.U. countries? Will they weaken the NATO alliance? 2) What impact will the tariffs have on England going into Brexit? 3) Will the TPP countries fare better for their new trade agreement? 4) Which countries are likely to fare better because of Trump‚Äôs tariffs?  Mary M, Raleigh, N.C. PK: This is all pretty small stuff so far: the E.U. is as big an economy as ours is, so it‚Äôs marginal there as here. I don‚Äôt think it affects the Brexit calculus at all. If Canada doesn‚Äôt get a sustained exemption, it‚Äôs a bigger deal: they‚Äôre a fairly small economy that supplies most of our aluminum imports. For now, the bigger impact is on foreign relations: now nobody trusts us, and China and Russia are the big winners from that distrust. How is it that so many economists of all political stripes agree that protective tariffs are bad? Up until the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle of the 1930s, weren‚Äôt tariffs a fairly common economic policy prescription? Did the Great Depression unfairly give tariffs a bad name or did the field of economics just advance beyond tariffs as part of the economic policy tool kit? ‚Äî Jason Williams Washington, D.C. PK: Actually, economists were overwhelmingly against Smoot-Hawley. There has always been a minority view supporting tariffs under certain circumstances ‚Äî usually for economic development. But the failure of import-substituting industrialization in Latin America and India largely discredited that view. Please respond to Daniel McCarthy‚Äôs Op-Ed point-for-point. His arguments are very convincing but counter to yours. Someone is drinking cool aid here and without an authentic debate it‚Äôs impossible to know which position is less self-serving. ‚Äî Michael, Chicago PK: Many readers asked a version of this question. McCarthy‚Äôs whole article is premised on the notion that protectionism can bring back a manufacturing-centered economy. I couldn‚Äôt find any facts at all about trade in his article, certainly no numbers. And if you actually do look at the numbers, you immediately realize that his whole premise is wrong: we could shut down trade completely and manufacturing would still employ less than 10 percent of the work force. So I‚Äôm not sure what to argue with. He didn‚Äôt do his homework. Dr. Krugman, assuming a reasonable fair and level playing field, wouldn‚Äôt a worldwide free-trade agreement benefit all of humanity? It would seem that products and services would be produced by the best and the most efficient and/or the closest in proximity to resources whether human or earth born. The E.U. is moving ahead with the TTP. Will this cripple U.S. trade in Asia? ‚Äî Steve, Seattle PK: TPP won‚Äôt make that much difference to trade, since it wasn‚Äôt mostly about trade (it was about intellectual property and dispute settlement). I‚Äôm less worried about the U.S. loss of trade than our loss of influence: we‚Äôre a less and less credible negotiating partner. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Ana Swanson WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump said on Monday that the United States would soon announce a ‚Äúreciprocal tax‚Äù on countries that take advantage of the United States on trade, including trading partners he described as ‚Äúso-called allies.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll send in their product, and we won‚Äôt charge them anything,‚Äù the president said during a meeting with mayors and governors to discuss his proposal for rebuilding American infrastructure. ‚ÄúAnd we send them our product ‚Äî same product as they‚Äôre sending us ‚Äî and they‚Äôll charge us 50 and 75 percent tax, and that‚Äôs very unfair.‚Äù Though the president said more information would be forthcoming as soon as this week, White House officials quickly played down his comments, with one senior administration official saying that the proposal was ‚Äúnothing formal right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe reciprocal tax is, simply, what you do to us, we‚Äôll do to you,‚Äù the official said. But when it comes to imposing reciprocal tariffs, trade analysts said the president‚Äôs hands were somewhat tied. The relatively low tariffs that the United States charges on many foreign goods were hammered out through decades of bargaining and bartering at the World Trade Organization. Tariffs charged on individual products in various countries can vary widely. Most countries, especially wealthier ones like the United States, have relatively low tariffs on imports but may have negotiated at the W.T.O. to protect some sensitive industries with a higher tariff. The W.T.O. might have the authority to overrule the administration should it enact new tariffs, an action that would then allow other countries to raise their own tariffs on American products as a punishment. To substantially raise its tariffs, the United States would most likely have to leave the W.T.O. ‚Äî a prospect that could damage the American economy given how globally integrated many companies have become. The White House has already taken action to impose tariffs on washing machines and solar power modules and is currently considering several other trade actions that could raise tariffs on specific products or countries. On Tuesday, the president will meet with lawmakers, including Ohio‚Äôs senators ‚Äî Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, and Rob Portman, a Republican ‚Äî to discuss an ongoing investigation into whether steel imports pose a national security threat by harming that industry in America. The administration began the investigation last spring, but the results were delayed amid pushback from economic and defense advisers. Senators Brown and Portman both support the tariffs. The administration is also weighing actions to penalize China for what it says is infringement on American intellectual property. That could result in tariffs on high-tech Chinese products, or restrictions on some kinds of Chinese investment in the United States. ‚ÄúWe cannot continue to be taken advantage of by other countries,‚Äù Mr. Trump said Monday. ‚ÄúWe cannot continue to let people come into our country and rob us blind, and charge us tremendous tariffs and taxes, and we charge them nothing.‚Äù He added that the United States was losing ‚Äúvast amounts of money with China and Japan and South Korea and so many other countries.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve gotten away with murder for 25 years,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre going to be changing policy.‚Äù Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the Morning Briefing newsletter.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Eileen Sullivan This article was updated on Feb. 2, 2018. For further coverage of the memo, read here ¬ª WASHINGTON ‚Äî House Republicans released a secret Intelligence Committee memo on Friday that accuses senior officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department of abuses in the early stages of the special counsel‚Äôs Russia investigation. Democrats say the memo is a partisan attempt to undermine the inquiry, and an assistant attorney general, Stephen E. Boyd, said that releasing it without an official review process would be ‚Äúextraordinarily reckless.‚Äù In an unusual public statement, the F.B.I. said it had ‚Äúgrave concerns‚Äù about releasing the memo. Here are answers to some basic questions. The memo is a short summary of some of the intelligence used to support a government request to secretly surveil Carter Page, the former Trump campaign associate. In order to obtain the warrant, the F.B.I. and the Justice Department had to show a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that they had probable cause to believe that Mr. Page was acting as a Russian agent. The memo describes four applications to surveil Mr. Page. The original request was made on Oct. 21, 2016; investigators have to seek approval to extend the surveillance every 90 days. The memo‚Äôs main argument is that the government, in seeking the warrant, did not disclose that information in the application came from research paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign. President Trump has said that the Democrats‚Äô financial ties to the research support his belief that the Democrats are behind the Russia controversy. The man behind the research is a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who compiled a dossier of explosive, unsubstantiated information about Mr. Trump and Russia. He told the F.B.I. that he was working for interests opposed to Mr. Trump, and the Republicans question whether the intelligence court judge was misled about Mr. Steele‚Äôs credibility. Some Republican lawmakers say the memo reveals that the F.B.I. was biased against Mr. Trump and misused its authorities in its investigation into Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 presidential election. ‚ÄúIn the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities before the F.I.S.C. to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts,‚Äù the memo said, referring to the intelligence court that approves these applications. ‚ÄúThe application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of ‚Äî and paid by ‚Äî the D.N.C. and Clinton campaign, or that the F.B.I. had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information.‚Äù But the claims of bias are undercut by another piece of information in the committee memo: that the top official at the Justice Department who is overseeing the Russia investigation, Rod J. Rosenstein, signed one of the warrants to continue the surveillance of Mr. Page. Mr. Rosenstein is a Republican and was appointed by Mr. Trump. Democrats say Republicans cherry-picked facts to create their own narrative ‚Äî one that shows that the government acted improperly in its application for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant and that senior officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department were leading a biased investigation into the president. The Republican memo was written by staff members on the House Intelligence Committee, whose chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, is a Trump loyalist and was on Mr. Trump‚Äôs presidential transition team. Mr. Nunes has previously claimed government abuses against Mr. Trump and his associates. Democrats say the Republicans are trying to distract from the continuing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which the president has called a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has already brought charges against four of Mr. Trump‚Äôs former aides. Mr. Mueller has told the president‚Äôs lawyers that he will probably seek to interview Mr. Trump. Stephen E. Boyd, the assistant attorney general, wrote to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, ahead of a House Intelligence Committee vote to release a memorandum that is said to accuse the F.B.I. of misusing their authority in the Russia investigation. Mr. Boyd called the step ""extraordinarily reckless."" The Democrats say Republicans are trying to protect the president at any cost. ‚ÄúThe sole purpose of the Republican document is to circle the wagons around the White House and insulate the president,‚Äù Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Friday. Mr. Schiff said Mr. Nunes had refused to say whether the Republican staff members who wrote the memo coordinated with the White House. The Democrats drafted their own memo to rebut the Republican narrative, but Republicans have so far blocked its release. Mr. Schiff said the premise of the Republican memo was that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department ‚Äúcorruptly sought a FISA warrant on a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and deliberately misled the court as part of a systematic abuse of the FISA process.‚Äù Mr. Schiff said that simply was not true. ‚ÄúThe F.B.I. had good reason to be concerned about Carter Page and would have been derelict in its responsibility to protect the country had it not sought a FISA warrant,‚Äù he said. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said the Republican memo distorted intelligence to ‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù national security agencies and Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation. ‚ÄúPresident Trump has surrendered his constitutional responsibility as commander in chief by releasing highly classified and distorted intelligence,‚Äù Ms. Pelosi said in a statement on Friday. ‚ÄúBy not protecting intelligence sources and methods, he just sent his friend Putin a bouquet.‚Äù The debate had morphed into something of a competition between the two parties over which was being more transparent about sensitive intelligence matters that are opaque by design. Republicans say they are making the public aware of government abuses and biases against Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúThe committee has discovered serious violations of the public trust, and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes,‚Äù Mr. Nunes said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Nunes added that he hoped ‚Äúthis alarming series of events‚Äù would lead to reforms, even though he recently pushed for the renewal of FISA authorities. ‚ÄúReleasing this memo is the first step to rooting out corruption in our bureaucratic agencies once and for all,‚Äù Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, said in a Twitter post on Friday. ‚ÄúThe American people deserved to know its contents and I‚Äôm glad we were able to get this into the public sphere.‚Äù Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, has said that the contents of the memo do not indict the F.B.I. or impugn Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation or the deputy attorney general, Mr. Rosenstein. When the government wants to get a warrant under the  FISA law, applications are made to a special court. These applications are highly classified and voluminous, sometimes 50 to 60 pages, according to John E. McLaughlin, a former C.I.A. deputy director. The deputy attorney general would typically approve this type of request. It‚Äôs unlikely a judge would approve a warrant after reading a few pages of information, so the Republicans‚Äô memo does not provide all of the information the judge reviewed. In some cases, the intelligence judge will tell government lawyers requesting a warrant that they need to show more evidence to support the application. Government lawyers often add to their applications until a judge is satisfied that the standard, known as probable cause, is met. The Republicans‚Äô memo, which did not include all the details from the FISA applications, showed that the government went through the usual approval process. Mr. Page was previously on the radar of intelligence agencies for years when Mr. Trump named him to be one of his foreign policy advisers in 2016. Mr. Page had visited Moscow in July 2016 and was preparing to return there that December when investigators obtained the warrant. Congress ‚Äî in particular the House and Senate Intelligence Committees ‚Äî has a mandate to oversee the activities of the executive branch, including American intelligence agencies, in part to ensure that intelligence is not being used for political gain. ‚ÄúWe have crossed a deeply regrettable line in this committee, where for the first time in the 10 years or so that I‚Äôve been on the committee, there was a vote to politicize the declassification process of intelligence, and potentially compromise sources and methods,‚Äù Mr. Schiff said on Monday after the panel voted to release the memo. That the House invoked a rule for the first time to release the memo underscores how unusual a predicament this is for members of the House Intelligence Committee. When the Intelligence Committees become political, oversight of the intelligence agencies becomes ‚Äújust about impossible,‚Äù said David M. Barrett, a professor of political science at Villanova University who has written a book on the C.I.A. and Congress. ‚ÄúIntelligence becomes just another political football.‚Äù The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting its own investigation into Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. But the panel has not had the type of openly political clashes that have marked the House committee‚Äôs inquiry. Mr. Page applauded the memo and its contents. ‚ÄúThe brave and assiduous oversight by congressional leaders in discovering this unprecedented abuse of process represents a giant, historic leap in the repair of America‚Äôs democracy,‚Äù Mr. Page said in a statement on Friday. Mr. Trump spoke briefly about the memo and said, ‚ÄúA lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that.‚Äù Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post, ‚ÄúThe top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans ‚Äî something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!‚Äù Even as Mr. Trump tried to show support of ‚Äúrank and file‚Äù agents, the attacks on the F.B.I. and the Justice Department raised concerns about trust in America‚Äôs law enforcement and intelligence officials. The president of the F.B.I. Agents Association, Thomas O‚ÄôConnor, said in a statement that F.B.I. agents continued to serve the American people. ‚ÄúFBI Special Agents have not, and will not, allow partisan politics to distract us from our solemn commitment to our mission,‚Äù Mr. O‚ÄôConnor said in a Twitter post. Democrats and some Republicans worry what the potential damage to intelligence sources and methods will be now that the memo has been released. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said attacks on the F.B.I. served the Kremlin, not Americans. ‚ÄúThe latest attacks on the F.B.I. and Department of Justice serve no American interests ‚Äî no party‚Äôs, no president‚Äôs, only Putin‚Äôs,‚Äù Mr. McCain said in a statement on Friday. James B. Comey, whom Mr. Trump fired in May as F.B.I. director, setting in motion the appointment of a special counsel to manage the Russia investigation, called the memo ‚Äúdishonest and misleading.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen,‚Äù Mr. Comey wrote in a Twitter post. ‚ÄúFor what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.‚Äù Emily Cochrane, Charlie Savage and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

Coach Tyronn Lue says Hill is available to play Sunday, but he wouldn't say if the veteran is starting. Lue did not reveal any of his starters. Hill was injured in the series opener and has been bothered by back spasms since. But with Cleveland's season on the line, the veteran wanted to play and Lue said Hill was cleared to go by the team's medical staff. Jose Calderon started the past three games in place of Hill, who was acquired at the Feb. 8 trade deadline from Sacramento. Hill is averaging 8.7 points and 1.7 assists in the series.

Sports,"Advertisement Supported by Warriors 113, Cavaliers 91 | Golden State leads series, 1-0 By Scott Cacciola OAKLAND, Calif. ‚Äî So much about the start of the N.B.A. finals on Thursday night felt familiar. It had everything to do, of course, with the two teams that took the court for Game 1 at Oracle Arena: the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers, back at it for the third straight year. The general hope ahead of the opening tip was that these two teams would be capable of reviving the playoffs, which had been mostly a glorified snooze-fest through the first three rounds. Between the two of them, Golden State and Cleveland lost a total of one game ‚Äî one! ‚Äî as they made their respective marches to the finals, leaving a trail of also-rans littered in their thunderous wakes. The league has a parity problem ‚Äî ‚ÄúObviously, they just blew through the playoffs,‚Äù Commissioner Adam Silver said of both teams before the game ‚Äî but most who tuned in for Thursday‚Äôs festivities expected improved competition. That was the assumption, anyway. Or maybe it was just a dream. The Warriors, the league‚Äôs resident superpower, delivered a 113-91 victory to strike the first blow in the best-of-seven series. It was nothing short of a drubbing. Kevin Durant, one of the newcomers to the rivalry, collected 38 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists to lead the Warriors, who shredded their defenders. Layups? Midrange jumpers? Distant 3-pointers? It was an offensive smorgasbord for Golden State, which sampled a bit of everything on the menu. ‚ÄúWe feel like we should be able to attack on every single play, and our guys did that,‚Äù said Mike Brown, the Warriors‚Äô acting head coach. Stephen Curry, who scored 28 points, demoralized the Cavaliers early in the third quarter with back-to-back 3-pointers to push the Warriors‚Äô lead to 20. They led by 21 entering the fourth. Golden State took great care of the ball throughout, finishing with 31 assists and four turnovers. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt imagine it,‚Äù Brown said of that disparity, ‚Äúespecially going into Game 1 against that team.‚Äù LeBron James, whose play for the Cavaliers through the first three rounds was virtually flawless, had an uneven game. He finished with 28 points, 15 rebounds and 8 assists but committed 8 turnovers. He was also assigned to defend Durant for much of the game, and that did not go well for him. ‚ÄúWe made a lot of mistakes,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúThey capitalized.‚Äù Kyrie Irving scored 24 points for Cleveland, and Kevin Love added 15. Undefeated in the playoffs, the Warriors have not lost a game since April 10, their second-to-last game of the regular season. As for Thursday‚Äôs thumping, consider that the Warriors‚Äô Klay Thompson shot 3 of 16 from the field. His teammates missed their share of layups. Durant did the math. ‚ÄúWe could be a lot better than we were tonight,‚Äù he said. For the Cavaliers, it was a return to the site of their greatest triumph. In Game 7 of last year‚Äôs finals, on this same court, the Cavaliers completed an improbable and unprecedented comeback to hoist the Larry O‚ÄôBrien Trophy before a dazed crowd at Oracle Arena. It was a bitter end to a historic season for the Warriors. Since then, both teams had made changes ‚Äî some major, some subtle. The Warriors added Durant to their already high-octane roster. (Put that in the ‚Äúmajor‚Äù category.) They also signed experienced role players like Zaza Pachulia and David West. The Cavaliers engineered their own midseason face-lift, acquiring point guard Deron Williams and the 3-point specialist Kyle Korver. By virtue of their shared playoff dominance, both teams arrived for Thursday‚Äôs game as fresh as organic produce. It had been 10 days since the Warriors completed their four-game sweep of the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference finals. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, went a week between games after eliminating the Boston Celtics in five games in the Eastern Conference finals. But while the Warriors have made their journey through the playoffs look almost effortless, they continue to cope with an unconventional situation. Midway through the first round, Coach Steve Kerr stepped away from his day-to-day duties to deal with continuing medical problems. On Thursday, Brown again manned the Warriors‚Äô bench. Kerr, who has remained actively involved behind the scenes, watched Thursday‚Äôs game on television from the home locker room. The game‚Äôs early moments were full of plodding and grabbing, bricks and whistles. On the Cavaliers‚Äô first possession, the Warriors forced Kevin Love into hoisting an air ball as the shot clock expired. Not long after, Durant nearly broke the backboard on a long jumper. Pachulia engaged in some form of wrestling with the Cavaliers‚Äô Tristan Thompson under the basket. James missed a free throw. Even the greatest players in the world were susceptible to nerves on the sport‚Äôs grandest stage. Soon enough, both teams settled into more of a rhythm. Durant, in particular, looked comfortable back in the finals ‚Äî his first appearance since 2012, back when he was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder. On Thursday, he scored 23 points in the first half. The Cavaliers‚Äô primary challenge was obvious: somehow slowing a team with the greatest assemblage of offensive talent in league history. In previous rounds, James had been conserved energy by defending lesser players. For however long this series lasts, no such vacations will be forthcoming. ‚ÄúWe know coming into this building, it‚Äôs going to be a tough game for us,‚Äù Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue said. ‚ÄúBut just getting a chance to see how they play, their style of play, how fast they play ‚Äî you can‚Äôt simulate that at practice.‚Äù On Thursday, James guarded Durant ‚Äî or tried as best he could. With 3-point threats like Curry and Thompson dragging defenders to the perimeter, Durant found seams to the basket. He had six dunks in the first half alone. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm going to dunk or when I‚Äôm going to get the wide-open 3,‚Äù Durant said. ‚ÄúI just try to go out there and play.‚Äù The Warriors are renowned for their 3-point shooting, but they spent the bulk of Thursday‚Äôs game dismantling the Cavaliers in the interior. The Warriors scored 42 points in the lane as they ran out to a 60-52 lead at halftime. The Cavaliers were not doing themselves any favors, committing 12 turnovers in the half ‚Äî seven by James. The Warriors committed one. On Wednesday, James acknowledged feeling distracted after the police said someone had spray-painted a racial slur on the front gate of a Los Angeles home that he owns. The Los Angeles Police Department said it was investigating the incident as a hate crime. James said he would focus on the game as best he could. On Thursday, the Cavaliers had no margin for error ‚Äî not against the Warriors, who turned another playoff game into a clinic.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Sports,"Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press NEW YORK ‚Äî The commission proposing reforms to college basketball wants 18-year-olds to be eligible again for the NBA draft, and the NBA Players Association would make that deal today. Change will take longer than that. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver senses the league's age limit isn't working. Requiring U.S. players to be 19 years old and one year removed from high school has sent many of them to a year of college they don't want, and delayed the full-time basketball instruction pro teams prefer. But whether the league would agree to allow players to come straight from high school again, or want them to wait two years before becoming draft eligible, has been a sticking point practically since the age limited was enacted in 2005 and remains unclear now. Before the age limit was in place, some stars flourished straight from high school including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett. The league and union were non-committal about change in a joint statement released Wednesday. ""Regarding the NBA's draft eligibility rules, the NBA and NBPA will continue to assess them in order to promote the best interests of players and the game,"" Silver and union executive director Michele Roberts said. The age limit once loomed as the biggest fight during the 2011 negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement. The league had signaled its desire to raise the age limit to 20, and the union wasn't going to agree to that. But the league shifted its goals toward extracting financial concessions from the players, and the age limit moved to the back burner and has stayed there. Now could be the time to finally move it forward. Change has to be bargained by the NBA and NBPA, but they don't need to wait for the next CBA to do it. And with nearly every team having its own G League affiliate, there is a legitimate minor league where 18-year-olds could play without having to do it on campus. WHY IT COULD WORK: Because the timing may be right. With now 27 teams, two-way contracts allowing easier paths to the NBA and a fresh increase in salary, the G League has never been closer to being an option on par with college. As shown recently when high school All-American Darius Bazley chose the G League over his commitment to play at Syracuse, even top players may consider it. WHY IT WOULDN'T WORK: Ending the age limit doesn't necessarily end one-and-done. Players who know they aren't going to make an NBA roster out of high school might prefer a tuition-paid year of being the big man on campus at Duke or Kentucky over a year in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Fort Wayne, Indiana, or some other G League city. WHY IT'S KEY TO THE SCANDAL: The report cries out for help with one-and-done, noting that ""only the NBA and the NBPA can change this rule."" The commission says it may have to recommend ending freshman eligibility or mandating that all scholarships be for three or four years if the age limit can't be ended in 2018. Silver may agree it's time for change, but it will come on the NBA and NBPA's timetable. ""We're not by any means rushing through this,"" he said during February's All-Star break. ""I think this is a case where, actually, outside of the cycle of collective bargaining, we can spend more time on it with the Players Association, talking to the individual players, talking to the executive board and really trying to understand the pros and cons of potentially moving the age limit."" ___ Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Reuters WASHINGTON ‚Äî Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. official overseeing an investigation of ties between President Donald Trump's election team and Russia, warned a group of conservative Republicans on Tuesday that his department would not be ""extorted"" and criticized them for leaking a draft resolution calling for his impeachment. Rosenstein, U.S. Deputy Attorney General, has been under fire since last May when he appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russia's suspected interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. The so-called House Freedom Caucus this week leaked a draft resolution that said Rosenstein should be impeached for not promptly responding to their requests for documents on FBI investigations. Rosenstein told an event in Washington on Tuesday: ""I just don't have anything to say about documents like that that nobody has the courage to put their name on and that they leak in that way.""  ""I can tell you that there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.""  The Kremlin denies allegations made by U.S. intelligence agencies that it interfered in the election to try to help Republican candidate Trump win it. Trump denies any coordination with Moscow officials by his campaign team, and he has repeatedly said the investigation is a political witch hunt.  A number of Republican-led committees in the U.S. House of Representatives have opened inquiries into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's handling of several matters.  They include an investigation of 2016 Democratic election candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was U.S. Secretary of State and whether the Justice Department made missteps when it applied to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) for a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly demanded access to records on those and other subjects. The Justice Department has said it is working to meet the requests while maintaining the integrity of open investigations. ""Everybody in the Department takes an oath,"" Rosenstein said on Tuesday. ""And if they violate it, they are going to be held accountable.""  The House lawmakers who drafted the articles of impeachment, he added, ""know that I'm not going to violate mine.""

Business,"Advertisement Supported by By Paul Krugman Will Trump back down from his urge to start a trade war? Nobody knows; the thing is, he‚Äôs been an ignorant trade hawk for decades, he‚Äôs feeling beleaguered on many fronts, and word is that his doctor has told him to eat fewer burgers. So there‚Äôs surely a lot of pent-up rage that he‚Äôs all too likely to take out on the world trading system, especially when he tweets stuff like this: The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our ‚Äúvery stupid‚Äù trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! So it‚Äôs worth asking what would happen if Trump really did try to close the trade gap ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually $500 billion, not $800 billion, but who‚Äôs counting ‚Äì by imposing tariffs. The trade gap is currently running a bit shy of 3 percent of GDP, while imports are 15 percent of GDP: If the price elasticity of import demand is around 1, which is a typical estimate for the short-to-medium run, a 20 percent across the board tariff might, other things equal, be enough to close the gap. But other things would very much not be equal. Leave aside the issue of foreign retaliation/emulation, although that would be a very big deal in practice. Assume instead that the U.S. gets away with it, with no foreign response. Even so, this wouldn‚Äôt work out the way Trump imagines. You see, diverting demand equal to 3 percent of GDP from foreign to domestic products would not increase US output by 3 percent relative to what it would have been otherwise, let alone the 4.5 percent you‚Äôd expect if there‚Äôs a multiplier effect. Why? Because the US is close to full employment. Maybe ‚Äì maybe ‚Äì we have another half-point of unemployment to go. But a 3 percent rise in output relative to trend would reduce unemployment about 3 times that much, 1.5 percentage points. And that just isn‚Äôt going to happen. What would happen instead is that the Fed would raise rates sharply to head off inflationary pressures (especially because a 20 percent tariff would directly raise prices by something like 3 percent.) The rise in interest rates would have two big effects. First, it would squeeze interest-sensitive sectors: Trump‚Äôs friends in real estate would become very, very unhappy, as would anyone who is highly leveraged (hello, Jared.) Second, it would drive up the dollar, inflicting severe harm on U.S. export sectors. Greetings, farmers of Iowa! So protectionism wouldn‚Äôt do very much to reduce the trade deficit, even if other countries didn‚Äôt retaliate, and would inflict a lot of pain across the economy. And that‚Äôs without getting into the dislocations caused by disruption of supply chains. Add in the fact that other countries would retaliate ‚Äì they‚Äôre already drawing up their target lists ‚Äì and the fact that we‚Äôd be alienating key allies, and you have a truly terrible, dumb policy idea. Which makes it quite likely, as I see it, that Trump will indeed follow through. Follow me on Twitter (@PaulKrugman) and Facebook.

Business,"Advertisement By REUTERSMAY 4, 2018, 11:25 A.M. E.D.T.  BERLIN ‚Äî  As Europe's biggest exporter to the United States and with more than 1 million German jobs at stake, Germany is desperate to avoid a European Union trade war with the United States. In the run-up to a June 1 deadline for U.S. President Donald Trump to impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Berlin is urging its European partners to show some flexibility and pursue a broad trade deal that benefits both sides. But that puts Germany at odds with European peers such as France. Paris, the other half of the motor driving European integration, resents Germany's big trade surplus and wants a tougher EU stance against the U.S. tariffs. ""There is a great danger of slipping into a trade war that way,"" Holger Bingmann, president of Germany's BGA foreign trade association, told Reuters. Advertisement Mindful of data from the German-American Chambers of Industry and Commerce that shows more than 1 million German jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on exports to the United States, he cautioned against EU threats of counter tariffs. Advertisement ""That way, the Europeans would only embrace the logic of protectionists,"" he said. The European Commission has said the EU will set duties on 2.8 billion euros (2.5 billion pounds) of U.S. exports, including peanut butter and denim jeans, if its metals exports to the United States, worth 6.4 billion euros, are subject to tariffs. Berlin is pushing the idea of an agreement to lower tariffs across a broad spectrum of products, especially in manufacturing. ""We can negotiate again ... but we should talk about all industrial tariffs,"" said a senior German official. A French official said there must first be a permanent and unconditional exemption for the EU from the steel and aluminium tariffs, adding: ""That's the prerequisite for any other option."" Such differences risk driving EU countries apart, weakening their bargaining position with Trump - playing into his hands as he tries to make U.S. businesses more competitive globally. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday that finding a common stance with France and formulating an offer to the United States were ""equally difficult"". So far, Germany and France's differences have largely been hidden behind the EU position that Washington must give it a permanent exemption from the steel an aluminium tariffs. Advertisement But as the June 1 deadline nears, EU trade ministers must resolve their differences quickly to give European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom a clear mandate for negotiations with the U.S. administration. ""BUILD BETTER CARS"" Concerned that a tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs could affect them next, German carmakers are trying to mitigate their exposure to any trade war. BMW has quietly stopped exporting its X3 offroader from the United States to China, retooling its factory in Shenyang, China to produce the X3 model locally. The X3 is now also produced at a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa. But any switch from one factory to another is costly, takes months to plan and implement, and is taken with a long-term view, BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said. ""We have to make decisions, like about factories in Spartanburg (South¬†Carolina) or factories in Mexico, which are based on a horizon of 20 to 30 years,"" he told Reuters in March.

""If we were to change our strategy whenever a tweet comes out, we would get crazy,"" he added. Tensions around the car sector have been stoked on both sides of the Atlantic. In January 2017, when he was president-elect, Trump complained there were many Mercedes-Benz luxury cars visible on New York streets and threatened to impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the United States. Sigmar Gabriel, then Germany's economy minister, replied that the United States should ""build better cars"". Gabriel's comments reflect the pride Germans feel in the quality products their country exports, a post-war success that has helped them regain respect and recognition abroad. Advertisement SURPLUS TENSION Yet the surpluses this success has brought are a bone of contention that affect Germany's relations with its peers. France has complained for years about Germany's current account surplus -- a measure of the flow of goods, services and investments -- which was the world's largest for the second year running in 2017. The head of the International Monetary Fund said in January the build-up of large current account surpluses in countries such as Germany was partly responsible for the rise of protectionism elsewhere. France wants Germany to steer its surplus towards economically weaker southern Europe and raise domestic investment to reduce the surplus. So too does the IMF and the United States, hoping that an increase in investment would stimulate domestic demand in Germany and help boost imports from its trading partners. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz presented government finance plans on Wednesday that showed investment rising this year and next, before decreasing through to 2022 to below the 2017 level. German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed trade with Trump in Washington last week but there was no sign of a breakthrough. In 2017, German exports to the United States reached 112 billion euros, more than twice the next biggest EU country, Britain, according to the Eurostat statistics office. Advertisement ""Germany's problem is a lack of realism with respect to its own fragile strategic situation,"" said Jan Techau, a director at The German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think tank. He said Berlin also showed a lack of awareness of the consequences of its economic policies and failed to realise ""its own strategic long-term interests are largely similar to those of the U.S."" Graphic: EU-U.S. trade - https://tmsnrt.rs/2rlClP3 (Additional reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and by Jean-Baptiste Vey in Paris, Editing in Timothy Heritage) We‚Äôre interested in your feedback on this page.

Business,"Advertisement By ANA SWANSON and JIM TANKERSLEYMAY 2, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Top Trump administration officials are arriving in China this week armed with tough talk about Beijing‚Äôs need to change its trade practices. But within the United States delegation there is little consensus about what concessions America should try to extract ‚Äî or the best approach to getting the Chinese to agree. Instead of a single point person with a clear set of demands, the White House is sending six trade and economic officials with differing ideas on how to approach China and who are deeply divided over the desirability of a trade war. Some advocate goals that do not align with what the American business community wants or what China is prepared to offer, raising questions about how productive a dialogue will be, and whether talks can prevent the world‚Äôs two largest economies from tipping into a deeper conflict. What unites the group is a view that China‚Äôs trade practices are unacceptable and that Washington will now call the shots. ‚ÄúThe discussions will take place in Beijing, the decisions will take place in Washington,‚Äù said Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser and longtime China critic who is among those traveling to Beijing. Advertisement China experts have said the trip is very likely to be more of a listening session, in which administration officials will wait to hear what the Chinese will offer. But without agreement or a clear list of goals from the American side, the Chinese may try to mollify officials by meeting only the most modest of their trade demands. That could include agreeing to buy additional American products to lower the trade surplus with the United States, reviving old economic dialogues between the countries, or cracking open some domestic markets to foreign competition ‚Äî but only those where Chinese companies are already securely dominant.                  American companies want a level playing field with their Chinese counterparts. China wants to build its industries into sophisticated global competitors. This week, both countries demonstrated a willingness to escalate trade tensions to defend their positions.             In general, China appears set to take a hard line. Chinese officials said they would not agree to a $100 billion reduction in the trade deficit that the Trump administration has demanded. And they do not plan to engage on ambitious United States demands to curb an industrial plan known as Made in China 2025. Advertisement The delegation also includes Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, who, like Mr. Navarro, embraces a more combative approach to dealing with China than other advisers on the trip. Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer have been focused on China‚Äôs trade practices for decades, and insist the country must make more dramatic changes to even the playing field for American companies. They also appear willing to follow through with the tariffs President Trump has threatened, despite the pain it could inflict on many American businesses and workers, if they view it as necessary to increase their leverage with the Chinese. Other members of the delegation, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council, appear more inclined to strike deals that would accomplish the president‚Äôs goal of reducing the gap between what America imports from China and what it sells to the country, and thus head off the risk of an escalating trade war. Also going on the trip are Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who has previously seemed receptive to striking deals; Everett Eissenstat, an experienced trade adviser; and Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China. Yukon Huang, a China scholar at the Carnegie Institute, called the group an ‚Äúideologically hybrid team‚Äù with competing views about what is really plaguing the U.S.-China relationship. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mixture between two camps: one focused on trade issues, one focused on technology wars,‚Äù Mr. Huang said. ‚ÄúThe reason it is such, and we don‚Äôt have a game plan, is the issues aren‚Äôt well understood.‚Äù Among the concerns are a range of practices, including barriers to entry, subsidies and regulations that pressure American companies to hand over sensitive trade secrets, which China uses to make national champions of its homegrown firms. These tactics have enabled the Chinese to dominate global industries like steel, aluminum and solar panels, and American trade advisers say they are currently tipping the playing field for industries of the future, including semiconductors, robotics, cloud computing, electric vehicles and biotechnology. Speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Lighthizer said that the United States had nearly a third of the world‚Äôs high-tech business, followed by China, and that China‚Äôs trade practices were imperiling the economic future of the United States. Advertisement ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always hoping but not always hopeful,‚Äù Mr. Lighthizer said about the prospect of success from the talks. Many American industry leaders support Mr. Lighthizer‚Äôs efforts to expand access to Chinese sectors that are restricted to American companies and protect American intellectual property from theft and coercion ‚Äî longstanding complaints of American business leaders about China‚Äôs tactics. But they are wary of the administration‚Äôs approach to resolving longstanding problems. Some business leaders fear that the Trump administration may simply accept Chinese offers to lower the trade surplus by buying more American goods and open up segments of the economy that are already mature, like financial services, electronic payments or the auto sector. On the other hand, they worry about the economic damage from a trade war if the anti-China wing of the delegation wins the internal debate and follows through with its threats. Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday that there were ‚Äúserious, growing and legitimate challenges‚Äù about Chinese practices, but he also cautioned against the effect of a tit-for-tat tariff war. ‚ÄúWe are deeply concerned that the proposed tariffs list and escalating tariff threats from the administration will not effectively advance our shared goal of changing these harmful Chinese practices,‚Äù he said.

Analysts continue to warn of potential risks to economic growth in the United States if administration officials cannot negotiate a quick resolution with the Chinese, and the tariffs go into effect. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note this week that new investment restrictions on China, which the administration plans to outline soon, could also rattle investors. ‚ÄúSome additional market-disruptive policy moves regarding U.S.-China trade seem likely,‚Äù Goldman‚Äôs Alec Phillips wrote in the research note, which played down the odds of success in this week‚Äôs talks. ‚ÄúWe believe a substantial breakthrough at this meeting is unlikely as the issues the U.S. has raised ‚Äî intellectual property policies, technology transfer, and the ‚ÄòMade in China 2025‚Äô strategy, in particular ‚Äî are not the type of technical trade issues that can be resolved quickly.‚Äù The National Association of Manufacturers, one of the most influential business lobbying groups in Washington, has been pressing Mr. Trump and his economic team to open negotiations with the Chinese on a free-trade agreement, an ambitious move that many trade experts doubt would bear fruit, given the past struggles of American negotiators who have tried to secure far more limited agreements with China. Advertisement Jay Timmons, the president of the manufacturers‚Äô group, urged Mr. Trump in a letter this year to ‚Äúconsider pursuing a truly modern, innovative and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement with China that wholly restructures our economic relationship.‚Äù The group‚Äôs vice president for international economic affairs, Linda Menghetti Dempsey, told a congressional subcommittee in April that such an effort would be ‚Äúat once both a radical idea and, in our estimation, the most pragmatic and effective way forward‚Äù on trade with China. The Obama administration attempted to negotiate a more limited agreement with China, a bilateral investment treaty, but could not finalize the deal before Mr. Trump took office. His team has not yet revived the talks. Manufacturers have discussed the plan directly with Mr. Kudlow and with Vice President Mike Pence. Proponents say they believe the idea could appeal to Mr. Trump‚Äôs preference for bilateral trade agreements and his confidence in his negotiation skills. However, White House officials have given no public indication that they are considering such a negotiation. Mr. Lighthizer, Mr. Navarro and other proponents of a harder line against China have argued that the Chinese tend to use such dialogues as a delaying tactic, and that past trade negotiations with them have not been productive.

Politics,"Advertisement By ALEXANDER BURNS and MICHAEL D. SHEARAPRIL 20, 2018  The Democratic National Committee opened a surprise legal assault on President Trump on Friday, filing a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the organization was the victim of a conspiracy by Russian officials, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential run. The 66-page complaint, filed in federal court in New York, uses the publicly known facts of the investigation into Russia‚Äôs election meddling to accuse Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates of illegally working with Russian intelligence agents to interfere with the outcome of the election. In the document, the committee accuses Republicans and the Russians of ‚Äúan act of previously unimaginable treachery.‚Äù The sweeping lawsuit startled Republicans in Washington as well as Democratic leaders, who were only briefed at the last minute about the D.N.C.‚Äôs plans to pursue civil litigation. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, said the committee had alerted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in Congress, ‚Äúwhen we were about to file.‚Äù Mr. Trump, in a tweet Friday evening, chided ‚Äúobstructionist Democrats‚Äù for filing the complaint and suggested it could backfire if Republicans got access in court to the D.N.C.‚Äôs hacked email servers.              Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.         Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for Mr. Trump‚Äôs 2020 re-election bid, called the D.N.C. allegations a ‚Äúsham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional and nearly insolvent Democratic Party.‚Äù Advertisement In a statement, Mr. Parscale accused Democrats of filing the lawsuit to drum up donations for the party. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve sunk to a new low to raise money,‚Äù Mr. Parscale said. Advertisement Denying any financial motivation, Mr. Perez said in an interview that the lawsuit had been taking shape for months, and recalled facing demands as early as the winter of 2017 to file suit against Mr. Trump for allegedly abetting foreign interference in an American election. He said he had instructed the committee to investigate that possibility, eventually engaging a plaintiffs‚Äô law firm, Cohen Milstein, to assemble the complaint filed on Friday. While there are multiple ongoing investigations of Mr. Trump and his campaign, most significantly by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Mr. Perez said the D.N.C. decided to move ahead with a civil suit because the committee believed there was an ongoing threat of foreign interference in American elections, and it was unclear when Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigation might conclude. And certain claims in the lawsuit, he said, face statutory expiration dates. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when Mueller will finish,‚Äù Mr. Perez said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very concerned about the run-up to the midterm elections.‚Äù Mr. Perez firmly denied that the lawsuit had a political purpose, but he appeared to allude at points to the possibility that civil litigation might bring to light damaging information about Mr. Trump and his associates. The complaint is largely based on information that has been disclosed in news reports and subsequent court proceedings. But if the lawsuit proceeds, the president and his campaign aides could be forced to disclose documents and submit to depositions that require them to answer questions under oath. To reach the discovery stage, lawsuits have to survive any motion to dismiss the litigation by the defendants. Mr. Perez suggested, for instance, that Mr. Trump‚Äôs tax returns would reveal ‚Äúshady conduct‚Äù if they were ever made public. Asked if part of the lawsuit‚Äôs aim was to force such disclosures, Mr. Perez demurred: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt given that any thought.‚Äù Advertisement In his statement deriding the suit, Mr. Parscale said that if the litigation proceeds, the Trump campaign would use discovery to seek out embarrassing information about Democrats, including Mr. Perez, and their handling of the 2016 presidential election.

View all New York Times newsletters. ‚ÄúThere is a great deal the American public wants to know about the corruption of the Democrats,‚Äù Mr. Parscale said. White House officials and a number of other defendants did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. Roger J. Stone Jr., a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump who is named as a defendant in the suit, dismissed it in an email as ‚Äúa left-wing conspiracy theory dressed up as a lawsuit.‚Äù In a statement forwarded by Mr. Stone, Rob Buschel, Mr. Stone‚Äôs lawyer, said he had not yet been served with the D.N.C. suit and described it as a ‚Äúregurgitation‚Äù of a complaint filed last year by Democrats alleging their privacy was invaded during the campaign. That litigation is still in progress. The Democrats‚Äô legal maneuver comes amid a swirl of intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Trump, his associates and their interactions with Russia. The president, who has long denied allegations of collusion, has repeatedly attacked the special counsel investigation this week and has vented angrily about renewed claims by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, that Mr. Trump sought to influence the bureau‚Äôs review of the election. Mr. Trump added Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and two other lawyers to his legal team this week. And on Thursday night, Mr. Trump thundered on social media that there was ‚ÄúNO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,‚Äù and again branded the whole Russia investigation as a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù The D.N.C. complaint is broad in its claims and stark in its language, naming a long list of defendants that includes Mr. Trump; his son, Donald Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner; the Russian government and its intelligence service; and a group of former campaign aides including Mr. Stone, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. There is substantial overlap between the targets of the D.N.C. lawsuit and the group of people known to be under investigation by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Manafort has been indicted by the special counsel, while Mr. Gates and Mr. Papadopoulos have both pleaded guilty to different charges. Advertisement The Democrats accused Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign of being ‚Äúa racketeering enterprise‚Äù that worked with the Russians and WikiLeaks in a conspiracy that included hacking email servers at the D.N.C. and leaking damaging information to the public. The Trump campaign had extensive warnings of the Russians‚Äô activities and intentions, the Democrats allege, embraced the meddling of a foreign power. The lawsuit demands monetary damages and a declaration that the defendants conspired to alter the course of the election. Mr. Perez said that the party had not worked on the lawsuit with Democratic leaders on the intelligence committees in the House and Senate, who are investigating contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia through legislative investigations. The lawsuit is not the first attempt by Democrats to use civil litigation in an effort to open another path toward investigating what happened in 2016 that could be carried out under the oversight of a judge ‚Äî even if President Trump were to shut down the special counsel‚Äôs criminal investigation and the congressional oversight probes, run by Republicans, were to fall short. Last July, two Democratic donors and a former staffer member filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit against Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign and Mr. Stone. It also accused them of conspiring in the release of hacked Democratic emails and files that exposed their personal information to the public. The timing of that earlier filing came just before a one-year statute of limitations for privacy invasion lawsuits was about to expire; WikiLeaks published the first archives of stolen Democratic National Committee emails on July 22, 2016. The privacy invasion case was organized by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group run by former Obama administration lawyers. In a statement, Protect Democracy on Friday noted that the new D.N.C. lawsuit draws on the same set of underlying facts as the earlier privacy-invasion litigation it brought on behalf of ‚Äúthree Americans whose personal information was exposed through a conspiracy involving the Trump campaign and Roger Stone.‚Äù It said it only learned about the existence of the D.N.C. lawsuit from press reports on Friday. The nine-month-old privacy invasion lawsuit is much further developed than the D.N.C. case. The judge overseeing it, Ellen S. Huvelle of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, has scheduled a May 17 hearing on the defendants‚Äô motions to dismiss.

Sports,"Advertisement    Scott Cacciola     ON PRO BASKETBALL MAY 21, 2017  SAN ANTONIO ‚Äî It sounds silly at this point, with the Golden State Warriors on the cusp of a third straight trip to the N.B.A. finals, to suggest that they faced challenges at the start of the season. Does possessing too much talent count as a challenge? Nevertheless, there was a chance, however slim, that this whole grand enterprise could have blown up. That the team‚Äôs vast assemblage of stars would have trouble sharing one basketball. That Kevin Durant would rub the team‚Äôs holdovers the wrong way. Or that a new batch of reserves would refuse to make the necessary sacrifices. Ron Adams, an assistant coach, referred to the unique ‚Äúhuman dynamics‚Äù at work and described the season as a fascinating experiment in team chemistry. In so many ways, it could have soured. Instead, the Warriors are sailing through the playoffs with the help of seven players ‚Äî and an associate head coach ‚Äî who were not employed by the team at this time last season. Yes, it obviously helps when one of those new players is Durant, an all-World scoring cyborg. But the Warriors are a different team from what they were a year ago. They have only made the transition look seamless. Advertisement ‚ÄúThis is such a selfless group,‚Äù said forward Matt Barnes, who signed with the Warriors in March. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve got superstars sacrificing and diving on the floor and doing whatever it takes to win, it‚Äôs easy for a role player to fit right in.‚Äù Advertisement The San Antonio Spurs can sense the sad end coming. At full strength, they probably could have pushed the Warriors in the Western Conference finals ‚Äî or at least made more of these games competitive. But the Spurs have been gutted by injuries and are in danger of being swept after their 120-108 loss in Game 3 on Saturday night. Tony Parker, the starting point guard, ruptured his left quadriceps tendon in the conference semifinals. Kawhi Leonard, a finalist for the N.B.A.‚Äôs Most Valuable Player Award, has missed the last two games with a sprained left ankle. And David Lee, a key reserve, left for the locker room in a wheelchair after injuring his left knee in Game 3. Manu Ginobili, making his 15th straight postseason appearance for San Antonio, did the math for Game 4, set for Monday night at AT&T Center. ‚ÄúFor us to win,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe have to play at a 10 level, and they have to play at a 7.‚Äù If the playoffs have been a well-advertised bore ‚Äî and this series has not helped ‚Äî there is at least the overwhelming likelihood of a rematch between the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals. After losing to the Cavaliers last season, the Warriors reshaped themselves by adding Durant and by overhauling their collection of role players. Everyone adapted. ‚ÄúI think you just kind of learn,‚Äù said James Michael McAdoo, a reserve forward in his third season with the team. ‚ÄúEveryone here wants to be successful. Everyone here wants to win championships. So everyone understands that there have to be sacrifices.‚Äù That word ‚Äî sacrifice ‚Äî is used often by the players, which might seem counterintuitive. After all, no team scored more than the Warriors during the regular season. There are plenty of shots to go around. But that is the point. They have turned sharing-is-caring into high art. The ball seldom sticks. It zips from one set of hands to the next, and the starters set the tone. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the most unselfish people I‚Äôve played with in my life,‚Äù JaVale McGee said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always looking. If you‚Äôre wide open, they‚Äôll pass it. They don‚Äôt force shots.‚Äù Advertisement McGee was one of the (relative) newcomers who made an impact in Game 3. Starting in place of the injured Zaza Pachulia, McGee scored all 16 of his points in the first half. David West, another newcomer, had 6 points and 5 assists off the bench.

In some ways, McGee and West could not be more different. Earlier this season, McGee had blankets made that featured the dozing face of Draymond Green and distributed them to his teammates. West, on the other hand, is known for his intensity ‚Äî the type of player who will scream, ‚ÄúYou guys need to relax!‚Äù in the huddle without quite grasping the irony. But the Warriors make it all work, blending their personalities and skill sets for the greater good. ‚ÄúEverybody has a voice,‚Äù said Mike Brown, who joined the Warriors as their associate head coach last summer. Brown has taken on more responsibility in recent weeks. When Coach Steve Kerr stepped away from his day-to-day duties in the first round to address continuing medical problems, Brown became the acting coach on the bench. He has since guided the team to nine straight victories. He, too, has altered parts of his approach to match the system already in place. ‚ÄúThe one thing that was extremely unique and kind of hard to understand right away is how loose it is here,‚Äù Brown said, recalling his early days with the organization. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extremely loose, but in a good way, and it fits this group of players. The more loose your organization is or your team is, the more ownership you‚Äôre giving your group.‚Äù The Warriors, who blast music at their workouts and warm up by launching halfcourt heaves, are a democracy. The players hold one another accountable. They practice the best form of peer pressure. At the same time, Adams could not overstate the outsize role Durant, one of the new guys, had played in ensuring that the team went about its usual business. ‚ÄúFor a player of his stature, it‚Äôs remarkable to me,‚Äù Adams said. ‚ÄúHe just wanted to fit in.‚Äù A version of this article appears in print on May 22, 2017, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Democracy, It Turns Out, Suits the Warriors Just Fine.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by The Shift By Kevin Roose Several years ago, tech enthusiasts in San Francisco began buzzing about a new and mysterious thing called Bitcoin. There were rumors that the virtual money, invented by a pseudonymous math genius named Satoshi Nakamoto, would revolutionize modern finance and render government-backed currency obsolete. Or maybe it was just a passing fad. I wanted to understand the phenomenon for myself. So in 2013, I bought a single Bitcoin, a clunky and labor-intensive process that involved going to a CVS and using MoneyGram to wire the dollar value of a Bitcoin ‚Äî which was around $140 at the time ‚Äî to a cryptocurrency exchange. I sold my Bitcoin a week later for a small loss, thoroughly unimpressed with the experience and pessimistic about the virtual money‚Äôs prospects. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin dream is all but dead,‚Äù I wrote. Hoo boy, did I blow it. Today, the Bitcoin I sold for about $140 would be worth more than $15,000, and cryptomania has seized the entire world. As of this week, Bitcoin futures are trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Coinbase, the largest consumer trading platform for Bitcoin, briefly crashed last week because of a huge influx of traffic. And while experts are warning that the exuberance around Bitcoin is a classic sign of a bubble, few think it will disappear altogether even in the event of a crash. [ALSO READ: What is Bitcoin and How Does it Work?] What happened? Why did so many people ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî get Bitcoin so spectacularly wrong? After a couple of weeks of thinking about it, I can point to at least five bad assumptions I made. I assumed that Bitcoin‚Äôs future depended on its everyday use. In the early days of Bitcoin, its proponents envisioned people using cryptocurrencies to buy food, pay their rent and make other day-to-day purchases. Eager to bring Bitcoin to the mainstream, they set up Bitcoin ATMs to facilitate easy transfers and encouraged their local restaurants and bars to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Today, though, hardly anyone is spending Bitcoin on actual goods and services. (Why would you, if the value could jump 40 percent in two days, as it did last week?) And few merchants have gone through the hassle of updating their systems to accept cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúThe disparity between virtually no merchant acceptance and Bitcoin‚Äôs rapid appreciation is striking,‚Äù a team of Morgan Stanley economists wrote earlier this year. As it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising. I assumed that the blockchain would eclipse Bitcoin itself. One of the earliest predictions among Bitcoin skeptics and boosters alike was that Bitcoin itself would be just a predecessor technology to the real, lasting innovation: the blockchain ‚Äî the peer-to-peer ledger system that records cryptocurrency transactions and allows them to operate without a central authority. I agreed, thinking that the blockchain had real promise, but that Bitcoin would ultimately fade away. Four years later, there has, in fact, been enormous hype around blockchain projects. (One British company added the word ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù to its name and saw its shares immediately jump nearly 400 percent.) But that frenzy hasn‚Äôt detracted from investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin itself ‚Äî in fact, it has amplified it. And the potential applicability of blockchain technology to all kinds of different industries, from auto manufacturing to insurance to groceries, has inspired lots of non-techies to learn about cryptocurrencies, and served as an intellectual on-ramp for new Bitcoin investors. I assumed that regulators would crack down faster. In the frontier days of cryptocurrency, it seemed that every other story was about how criminals and tax-evaders were using Bitcoin to buy and sell illegal goods and services. A huge dark-net narcotics market, Silk Road, was broken up, and its owner was sentenced to life in prison. Several large cryptocurrency sites suffered hacks and thefts. It was easy to think that these problems would lead regulators to take swift action against Bitcoin. But regulators have been late to the game. The I.R.S. didn‚Äôt issue official guidance on the tax treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies until 2014, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has just recently started to look at whether initial coin offerings, a kind of public auction of new cryptocurrencies, should be more closely regulated. [ALSO READ: Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy] Partly, this is because some Trump-era regulators seem more interested in rolling back existing rules than making new ones. But it‚Äôs also a reflection of the way regulators tend to operate ‚Äî many are reactive, and Bitcoin is still a relatively esoteric product that hasn‚Äôt claimed many real-world victims yet. There might well be a regulatory reckoning as Bitcoin moves closer to the mainstream, but for now, it‚Äôs still the Wild West. I assumed that Wall Street would stay away. Back in 2013, when I began asking Wall Street bankers about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their reactions ranged from polite dismissal to outright mockery. Few thought digital currency had any chance of succeeding, and many shared the view of Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who has called Bitcoin a ‚Äúfraud‚Äù that would only appeal to murderers and drug dealers. But banks are ultimately service businesses, and I underestimated Wall Street‚Äôs philosophical flexibility when confronted with a new product that its clients really wanted to trade. Now, in the same way that the rise of junk bonds created an entirely new lucrative finance niche in the 1980s, Bitcoin‚Äôs rapid ascent has pulled even the most traditional financial institutions into the fray. There are now dozens of cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds, and even Goldman Sachs is clearing Bitcoin futures transactions for some clients. The arrival of institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market has begun to make Bitcoin look less like a fringe technology project, and more like any other securities market. I assumed that Bitcoin‚Äôs extreme volatility would be a turnoff. When Bitcoin‚Äôs price was swinging wildly between $100 and $200, sometimes within a few days, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWho would sign up for such a roller-coaster ride?‚Äù I na√Øvely thought that what people liked about money was its stability, and knowing that $100 today would still be worth $100 tomorrow. But you know what‚Äôs more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos! People love to gamble, and the spectacular rise of Bitcoin ‚Äî especially in the age of social media, which tends to hasten trends and encourage bandwagon behavior ‚Äî has encouraged a set of thrill-seeking speculators to bet big on the currency, hoping to make a quick buck and get out before a crash. This behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren‚Äôt keeping pace with inflation, there aren‚Äôt many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person. Many Bitcoin buyers aren‚Äôt bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10 ‚Äî in fact, that‚Äôs part of the appeal. Real Bitcoin enthusiasts, of course, will say that I‚Äôm still missing the point, and that today‚Äôs trading mania is just a prelude to an even bigger, more transformational era of cryptocurrency. And while I still have my doubts, I can‚Äôt credibly predict that they‚Äôre wrong. After all, look what happened the first time.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
Politics,"Advertisement By CHRIS STANFORDAPRIL 6, 2018   (Want to get this briefing by email? Here‚Äôs the sign-up.) Good morning. Here‚Äôs what you need to know: ‚Ä¢ The U.S. is considering tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese products, President Trump said on Thursday, escalating a potentially damaging trade dispute with Beijing. It was the latest volley in a back and forth between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. Here‚Äôs how we got to this point. ‚Ä¢ Beijing  is trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the American political system. Our correspondent there explains why China is confident it would win a trade war. Washington imposed sanctions on some of Russia‚Äôs richest men and top officials today, punishing President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs inner circle for Russian aggressions. Advertisement The move is intended to penalize some industrialists who are seen in the West as enriching themselves from Mr. Putin‚Äôs increasingly authoritarian administration. Advertisement ‚Ä¢ They grow out of an oddly disjointed policy: While President Trump continues to call for good relations with Mr. Putin, Congress and much of the rest of the administration are pushing through increasingly punitive efforts that are sinking relations with Moscow to lows not seen in years. ‚Ä¢ At least five officials at the Environmental Protection Agency were sidelined in the past year after raising concerns about spending and management by the agency‚Äôs administrator, Scott Pruitt. Among Mr. Pruitt‚Äôs requests, some of which were declined: a $100,000-a-month charter aircraft membership, a bulletproof security desk, a 20-person protective detail and the use of lights and sirens to speed his motorcade‚Äôs trips through Washington (including to a trendy French restaurant). The E.P.A. challenged the assertion that the officials‚Äô reassignments and their objections were related. ‚ÄúWe dispute the veracity of the accusations,‚Äù an agency spokesman said. ‚Ä¢ Senior White House officials say Mr. Pruitt‚Äôs fate is uncertain as he confronts a growing series of ethical questions. ‚Ä¢ In his first public comments about the matter, President Trump said on Thursday that he didn‚Äôt know about a $130,000 payment to a pornographic film actress who claims to have had a sexual relationship with him. Asked why Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer, had made the payment, Mr. Trump said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to ask Michael Cohen.‚Äù Advertisement Mr. Trump‚Äôs remarks came after an appearance in West Virginia in which he literally tossed out his ‚Äúboring‚Äù speech to renew his criticism of U.S. immigration law and to assert that millions voted illegally in the 2016 election. ‚Ä¢ Some of his claims don‚Äôt add up. President Trump delivered a lengthy criticism of current immigration policy, accused Democrats of using ‚Äúchain migration‚Äù to get votes and repeated unfounded claims of election fraud. ‚Ä¢ It was a presidential corruption scandal that exposed entrenched ties between South Korea‚Äôs government and huge conglomerates like Samsung. Park Geun-hye, the country‚Äôs former president, was sentenced today to 24 years in prison. She and a longtime friend were accused of collecting or demanding large bribes from three big businesses. ‚Ä¢ Almost all of South Korea‚Äôs presidents have seen their reputations tarnished by corruption scandals involving them, their relatives or their aides. Anchors on local stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group were forced to read identical scripts warning about ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ The shooting at YouTube headquarters this week highlighted security risks in the workplace. Many companies are similarly exposed, as an open-door policy pervades corporate America. ‚Ä¢ The U.S. added 103,000 jobs in March, down from February‚Äôs pace but strong enough to extend a record run of hiring.

Business,"Advertisement By KEITH BRADSHERAPRIL 16, 2018  SHANGHAI ‚Äî China‚Äôs economy grew at a healthy pace in the first three months of this year, propelled by strong household spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure. It was also helped ‚Äî albeit much more modestly ‚Äî by a factor that could exacerbate the country‚Äôs tense relations with Washington: China is selling a lot more to the United States, and its purchases from America aren‚Äôt keeping up. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing announced Tuesday morning that the economy had expanded 6.8 percent in the first quarter compared with the same quarter last year. That was well ahead of the pace necessary to hit the government‚Äôs target of 6.5 percent growth for the entire year. The country‚Äôs quarterly growth figure has become so implausibly smooth and predictable in recent years that economists generally look for other ways to gauge China‚Äôs economic health. Advertisement Data released on Tuesday indicated that growth might have been cooling by the end of the quarter. Industrial production rose 6 percent in March, less than most economists had expected. Urban fixed-asset investment also rose less than expected. Advertisement The central bank announced a measure Tuesday evening that would make it easier for commercial banks to keep lending, a move that would tend to support continued economic growth and that could indicate concern on the bank‚Äôs part. The central bank, the People‚Äôs Bank of China, said that it was reducing by a full percentage point the reserves that commercial banks are required to deposit with it, freeing up more cash for commercial banks to lend to businesses and households. Another measure experts look to for insight into China‚Äôs economy is trade, which at one time was a major driver of Chinese growth. Over the last decade, however, it has been far eclipsed in importance by Chinese investment and household spending. The latest figures show exports to the United States are growing considerably faster than China‚Äôs purchases of American goods. That could provoke more ire from President Trump, who had threatened to impose $150 billion in tariffs on Chinese products. The trade figures present a mixed picture of how painful those tariffs could be for China. Over all, trade is not as important to China‚Äôs economy as it was a decade ago, suggesting the country could better weather a trade fight. But the data also suggests China‚Äôs exports to the United States, specifically, have become more valuable to China‚Äôs economy as it increasingly makes most ‚Äî or even all ‚Äî of the parts that go inside what it sells abroad. APRIL 16, 2018  Mr. Trump has focused on China‚Äôs trade surplus with the United States, or the difference between what it sells to America and what it buys. And in the first three months of the year, the trade surplus for goods hit a new high of $58 billion, according to Chinese data. Trade in services, in which the United States is stronger, is tiny compared with the trade in goods, and offsets only about a tenth of the deficit in goods. China‚Äôs surplus on goods with the United States last year totaled $375 billion, according to Washington, or $276 billion, according to Beijing. The United States includes Chinese goods shipped by way of Hong Kong, a Chinese city that operates under its own laws, while Beijing‚Äôs statistics do not. Either way, China‚Äôs surplus has been rising. APRIL 16, 2018  Mr. Trump wants China‚Äôs annual trade surplus to shrink by $100 billion ‚Äî a reversal that could lower China‚Äôs entire economic output by nearly a full percentage point if the Chinese factories producing those goods simply shut down. Advertisement Xing Zhihong, the spokesman for China‚Äôs statistics bureau, said on Tuesday that China did not try to have a trade surplus with the rest of the world, and noted that it was narrowing overall. He also dismissed the idea that trade frictions with the United State could stymie growth. ‚ÄúSino-American trade frictions cannot cause a slowdown in the Chinese economy, nor change the good momentum in China‚Äôs economic development,‚Äù Mr. Xing said. Strictly by the numbers, China‚Äôs trade surplus with the United States helps Chinese economic growth figures, though the reality of the relationship between the countries is more complex. Many American consumers and companies benefit from Chinese-made goods, and a number of economists doubt that Mr. Trump‚Äôs focus on lowering the trade surplus with a single country will help the United States. On their face, the numbers suggest that American businesses have become dependent on China. And in fact, China‚Äôs trade surplus with the United States is growing even as its surplus with the rest of the world has shrunk. APRIL 16, 2018  But something else is going on: China is depending more on itself. China was once famous for assembling goods made from parts that had been bought elsewhere. A smartphone that is made in China, for example, might have a screen from Japan, memory chips from South Korea and a main processor from the United States. In fact, those parts and components long accounted for a sizable chunk of what China bought from the United States. Today, China can do all that entirely within its own borders, making everything from advanced electronic components to car parts and assembling the final product.

Global automakers and other multinational companies have moved much of their supply chains to China to avoid Chinese tariffs, tap the country‚Äôs vast work force and move closer to a big new market. Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist, calculated that imports of manufactured goods from the United States are becoming steadily less important to the Chinese economy. He estimated that China now produces within its borders up to four-fifths of the value of each dollar of exports. That share had been as little as two-thirds in 2011. Nadim Ahmad, the head of the trade and competitiveness statistics division at the O.E.C.D., said that China has been expanding in areas like research, design and development that had previously been done overseas. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre basically creating a lot more in the economy‚Äù as goods are manufactured, he said. Advertisement That means China gets more bang from its buck from its exports to the United States ‚Äî and suggests American tariffs could be more painful than trade‚Äôs shrinking share of the economy suggests.

Politics,"Advertisement By MICHIKO KAKUTANIAPRIL 12, 2018  A HIGHER LOYALTY Truth, Lies, and Leadership By James Comey 290 pages. Flatiron Books. $29.99. In his absorbing new book, ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty,‚Äù the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey calls the Trump presidency a ‚Äúforest fire‚Äù that is doing serious damage to the country‚Äôs norms and traditions. ‚ÄúThis president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,‚Äù Comey writes. ‚ÄúHis leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.‚Äù Decades before he led the F.B.I.‚Äôs investigation into whether members of Trump‚Äôs campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Comey was a career prosecutor who helped dismantle the Gambino crime family; and he doesn‚Äôt hesitate in these pages to draw a direct analogy between the Mafia bosses he helped pack off to prison years ago and the current occupant of the Oval Office. A February 2017 meeting in the White House with Trump and then chief of staff Reince Priebus left Comey recalling his days as a federal prosecutor facing off against the Mob: ‚ÄúThe silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. The loyalty oaths. The us-versus-them worldview. The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.‚Äù An earlier visit to Trump Tower in January made Comey think about the New York Mafia social clubs he knew as a Manhattan prosecutor in the 1980s and 1990s ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Ravenite. The Palma Boys. Caf√© Giardino.‚Äù Advertisement The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law. Dishonesty, he writes, was central ‚Äúto the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic,‚Äù and so, too, were bullying, peer pressure and groupthink ‚Äî repellent traits shared by Trump and company, he suggests, and now infecting our culture. Advertisement [ALSO READ: James B. Comey: By the Book] ‚ÄúWe are experiencing a dangerous time in our country,‚Äù Comey writes, ‚Äúwith a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored, excused or rewarded.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty‚Äù is the first big memoir by a key player in the alarming melodrama that is the Trump administration. Comey, who was abruptly fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, has worked in three administrations, and his book underscores just how outside presidential norms Trump‚Äôs behavior has been ‚Äî how ignorant he is about his basic duties as president, and how willfully he has flouted the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy, including the essential independence of the judiciary and law enforcement. Comey‚Äôs book fleshes out the testimony he gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017 with considerable emotional detail, and it showcases its author‚Äôs gift for narrative ‚Äî a skill he clearly honed during his days as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. The volume offers little in the way of hard news revelations about investigations by the F.B.I. or the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III (not unexpectedly, given that such investigations are ongoing and involve classified material), and it lacks the rigorous legal analysis that made Jack Goldsmith‚Äôs 2007 book ‚ÄúThe Terror Presidency‚Äù so incisive about larger dynamics within the Bush administration. What ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty‚Äù does give readers are some near-cinematic accounts of what Comey was thinking when, as he‚Äôs previously said, Trump demanded loyalty from him during a one-on-one dinner at the White House; when Trump pressured him to let go of the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn; and when the president asked what Comey could do to ‚Äúlift the cloud‚Äù of the Russia investigation. There are some methodical explanations in these pages of the reasoning behind the momentous decisions Comey made regarding Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails during the 2016 campaign ‚Äî explanations that attest to his nonpartisan and well-intentioned efforts to protect the independence of the F.B.I., but that will leave at least some readers still questioning the judgment calls he made, including the different approaches he took in handling the bureau‚Äôs investigation into Clinton (which was made public) and its investigation into the Trump campaign (which was handled with traditional F.B.I. secrecy). ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty‚Äù also provides sharp sketches of key players in three presidential administrations. Comey draws a scathing portrait of Vice President Dick Cheney‚Äôs legal adviser David S. Addington, who spearheaded the arguments of many hard-liners in the George W. Bush White House; Comey describes their point of view: ‚ÄúThe war on terrorism justified stretching, if not breaking, the written law.‚Äù He depicts Bush national security adviser and later Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as uninterested in having a detailed policy discussion of interrogation policy and the question of torture. He takes Barack Obama‚Äôs attorney general Loretta Lynch to task for asking him to refer to the Clinton email case as a ‚Äúmatter,‚Äù not an ‚Äúinvestigation.‚Äù (Comey tartly notes that ‚Äúthe F.B.I. didn‚Äôt do ‚Äòmatters.‚Äô‚Äù) And he compares Trump‚Äôs attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to Alberto R. Gonzales, who served in the same position under Bush, writing that both were ‚Äúoverwhelmed and overmatched by the job,‚Äù but ‚ÄúSessions lacked the kindness Gonzales radiated.‚Äù Comey is what Saul Bellow called a ‚Äúfirst-class noticer.‚Äù He notices, for instance, ‚Äúthe soft white pouches under‚Äù Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúexpressionless blue eyes‚Äù; coyly observes that the president‚Äôs hands are smaller than his own ‚Äúbut did not seem unusually so‚Äù; and points out that he never saw Trump laugh ‚Äî a sign, Comey suspects, of his ‚Äúdeep insecurity, his inability to be vulnerable or to risk himself by appreciating the humor of others, which, on reflection, is really very sad in a leader, and a little scary in a president.‚Äù Advertisement During his Senate testimony last June, Comey was boy-scout polite (‚ÄúLordy, I hope there are tapes‚Äù) and somewhat elliptical in explaining why he decided to write detailed memos after each of his encounters with Trump (something he did not do with Presidents Obama or Bush), talking gingerly about ‚Äúthe nature of the person I was interacting with.‚Äù Here, however, Comey is blunt about what he thinks of the president, comparing Trump‚Äôs demand for loyalty over dinner to ‚ÄúSammy the Bull‚Äôs Cosa Nostra induction ceremony ‚Äî with Trump, in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a ‚Äòmade man.‚Äô‚Äù Throughout his tenure in the Bush and Obama administrations (he served as deputy attorney general under Bush, and was selected to lead the F.B.I. by Obama in 2013), Comey was known for his fierce, go-it-alone independence, and Trump‚Äôs behavior catalyzed his worst fears ‚Äî that the president symbolically wanted the leaders of the law enforcement and national security agencies to come ‚Äúforward and kiss the great man‚Äôs ring.‚Äù Comey was feeling unnerved from the moment he met Trump. In his recent book ‚ÄúFire and Fury,‚Äù Michael Wolff wrote that Trump ‚Äúinvariably thought people found him irresistible,‚Äù and felt sure, early on, that ‚Äúhe could woo and flatter the F.B.I. director into positive feeling for him, if not outright submission‚Äù (in what the reader takes as yet another instance of the president‚Äôs inability to process reality or step beyond his own narcissistic delusions). After he failed to get that submission and the Russia cloud continued to hover, Trump fired Comey; the following day he told Russian officials during a meeting in the Oval Office that firing the F.B.I. director ‚Äî whom he called ‚Äúa real nut job‚Äù ‚Äî relieved ‚Äúgreat pressure‚Äù on him. A week later, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. During Comey‚Äôs testimony, one senator observed that the often contradictory accounts that the president and former F.B.I. director gave of their one-on-one interactions came down to ‚ÄúWho should we believe?‚Äù As a prosecutor, Comey replied, he used to tell juries trying to evaluate a witness that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt cherry-pick‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say, ‚ÄòI like these things he said, but on this, he‚Äôs a dirty, rotten liar.‚Äô You got to take it all together.‚Äù  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Put the two men‚Äôs records, their reputations, even their respective books, side by side, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine two more polar opposites than Trump and Comey: They are as antipodean as the untethered, sybaritic Al Capone and the square, diligent G-man Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma‚Äôs 1987 movie ‚ÄúThe Untouchables‚Äù; or the vengeful outlaw Frank Miller and Gary Cooper‚Äôs stoic, duty-driven marshal Will Kane in Fred Zinnemann‚Äôs 1952 classic ‚ÄúHigh Noon.‚Äù One is an avatar of chaos with autocratic instincts and a resentment of the so-called ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù who has waged an assault on the institutions that uphold the Constitution. [ALSO READ: Comey‚Äôs Memoir Offers Visceral Details on a President ‚ÄòUntethered to Truth‚Äô] The other is a straight-arrow bureaucrat, an apostle of order and the rule of law, whose reputation as a defender of the Constitution was indelibly shaped by his decision, one night in 2004, to rush to the hospital room of his boss, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft, to prevent Bush White House officials from persuading the ailing Ashcroft to reauthorize an N.S.A. surveillance program that members of the Justice Department believed violated the law. One uses language incoherently on Twitter and in person, emitting a relentless stream of lies, insults, boasts, dog-whistles, divisive appeals to anger and fear, and attacks on institutions, individuals, companies, religions, countries, continents. The other chooses his words carefully to make sure there is ‚Äúno fuzz‚Äù to what he is saying, someone so self-conscious about his reputation as a person of integrity that when he gave his colleague James R. Clapper, then director of national intelligence, a tie decorated with little martini glasses, he made sure to tell him it was a regift from his brother-in-law. Advertisement One is an impulsive, utterly transactional narcissist who, so far in office, The Washington Post calculated, has made an average of six false or misleading claims a day; a winner-take-all bully with a nihilistic view of the world. ‚ÄúBe paranoid,‚Äù he advises in one of his own books. In another: ‚ÄúWhen somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.‚Äù The other wrote his college thesis on religion and politics, embracing Reinhold Niebuhr‚Äôs argument that ‚Äúthe Christian must enter the political realm in some way‚Äù in order to pursue justice, which keeps ‚Äúthe strong from consuming the weak.‚Äù Until his cover was blown, Comey shared nature photographs on Twitter using the name ‚ÄúReinhold Niebuhr,‚Äù and both his 1982 thesis and this memoir highlight how much Niebuhr‚Äôs work resonated with him. They also attest to how a harrowing experience he had as a high school senior ‚Äî when he and his brother were held captive, in their parents‚Äô New Jersey home, by an armed gunman ‚Äî must have left him with a lasting awareness of justice and mortality. Long passages in Comey‚Äôs thesis are also devoted to explicating the various sorts of pride that Niebuhr argued could afflict human beings ‚Äî most notably, moral pride and spiritual pride, which can lead to the sin of self-righteousness. And in ‚ÄúA Higher Loyalty,‚Äù Comey provides an inventory of his own flaws, writing that he can be ‚Äústubborn, prideful, overconfident and driven by ego.‚Äù Those characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comey‚Äôs account of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, wherein he seems to have felt a moral imperative to address, in a July 2016 press conference, what he described as her ‚Äúextremely careless‚Äù handling of ‚Äúvery sensitive, highly classified information,‚Äù even though he went on to conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her. His announcement marked a departure from precedent in that it was done without coordination with Department of Justice leadership and offered more detail about the bureau‚Äôs evaluation of the case than usual. As for his controversial disclosure on Oct. 28, 2016, 11 days before the election, that the F.B.I. was reviewing more Clinton emails that might be pertinent to its earlier investigation, Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinton was going to win. He has repeatedly asked himself, he writes, whether he was influenced by that assumption: ‚ÄúIt is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls. But I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He adds that he hopes ‚Äúvery much that what we did ‚Äî what I did ‚Äî wasn‚Äôt a deciding factor in the election.‚Äù In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Comey stated that the very idea that his decisions might have had an impact on the outcome of the presidential race left him feeling ‚Äúmildly nauseous‚Äù ‚Äî or, as one of his grammatically minded daughters corrected him, ‚Äúnauseated.‚Äù Trump was reportedly infuriated by Comey‚Äôs ‚Äúnauseous‚Äù remark; less than a week later he fired the F.B.I. director ‚Äî an act regarded by some legal scholars as possible evidence of obstruction of justice, and that quickly led to the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller and an even bigger cloud over the White House. It‚Äôs ironic that Comey, who wanted to shield the F.B.I. from politics, should have ended up putting the bureau in the midst of the 2016 election firestorm; just as it‚Äôs ironic (and oddly fitting) that a civil servant who has prided himself on being apolitical and independent should find himself reviled by both Trump and Clinton, and thrust into the center of another tipping point in history. Advertisement They are ironies that would have been appreciated by Comey‚Äôs hero Niebuhr, who wrote as much about the limits, contingencies and unforeseen consequences of human decision-making as he did about the dangers of moral complacency and about the necessity of entering the political arena to try to make a difference.

Politics,"Advertisement By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS and EILEEN SULLIVANAPRIL 18, 2018  WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Trump, confronting legal threats on multiple sides, sought on Wednesday to discredit a pornographic actress alleging a sexual encounter with him and investigators examining whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 election, saying both were dealing in fake allegations. Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Wednesday to deny the claim by Stephanie Clifford, the actress also known as Stormy Daniels who has said she had an affair with him in 2006, that Mr. Trump dispatched a man to physically threaten her years ago. The president called a composite sketch of the man released on Tuesday by Ms. Clifford‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äúa total con job,‚Äù marking only the second time he has weighed in on the subject after weeks of frenzied news media coverage.              A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)! https://t.co/9Is7mHBFda  His tweet accompanied a post from another Twitter user, who said the man looked like Ms. Clifford‚Äôs former husband. In a news conference later in the day, Mr. Trump again referred to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russia‚Äôs election interference and whether the president has obstructed justice as a ‚Äúhoax.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúThis was a, really a hoax created largely by the Democrats as a way of softening the blow of a loss‚Äù in the election, he said during a news conference with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. Advertisement Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would seek to remove Mr. Mueller or Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the investigation, as he has frequently discussed doing privately. He offered only that despite speculation, he had yet to remove them. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been saying I‚Äôm going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months ‚Äî and they‚Äôre still here,‚Äù Mr. Trump said. The president said he had instructed his lawyers to be ‚Äútotally transparent,‚Äù and he called for a quick end to the investigation. ‚ÄúWe are hopefully coming to the end,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is a bad thing for our country ‚Äî very, very bad thing for our country. But there has been no collusion. They won‚Äôt find any collusion. It doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù Mr. Trump has said far less about the situation with Ms. Clifford. In making fun of the sketch, Mr. Trump shared it with his more than 50 million Twitter followers. And, according to Ms. Clifford‚Äôs lawyer, the president‚Äôs comments on Wednesday could lead to a defamation claim. Mr. Trump‚Äôs representatives have denied that the two had a sexual encounter. And the president‚Äôs advisers have cautioned him not to make public comments or post tweets about the matter. Ms. Clifford says the man in the sketch threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 while she was with her infant daughter. Advertisement ‚ÄúA guy walked up on me and said to me: ‚ÄòLeave Trump alone. Forget the story.‚Äô And he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a beautiful little girl, it would be a shame if something happened to her mom,‚Äô‚Äù Ms. Clifford said in March during an interview aired on ‚Äú60 Minutes.‚Äù Ms. Daniels and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, are offering a $131,000 reward for the person who identifies the man in the sketch.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Ms. Clifford has said Mr. Trump‚Äôs longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid her $130,000 to keep quiet about the encounter, which she has said she had with Mr. Trump while he was married. The F.B.I. has been investigating Mr. Cohen for bank fraud related to this payment and other matters. Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in California last month in which she claims a nondisclosure agreement she signed shortly before the 2016 presidential election was null and void because Mr. Trump never signed it. Mr. Trump, who is known for tweeting his mind, has said little about the scandal. This month, he denied knowing about the payment Mr. Cohen made. Mr. Avenatti has said the president‚Äôs denial only helps his client‚Äôs case. In his own Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Avenatti appeared to regard the president‚Äôs tweet as a gift and called Mr. Trump a ‚Äúcompletely unhinged, undisciplined opponent.‚Äù              In my experience, there is nothing better in litigation than having a completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent who is prone to shooting himself in the foot. Always leads to BIGLY problems‚Ä¶like new claims (i.e. defamation). LOL. #xmas #hanukkah #basta  Mr. Avenatti also tweeted on Wednesday that evidence collected in an F.B.I. raid on Mr. Cohen‚Äôs office and residences would reveal documents and recordings ‚Äúshowing con job after con job.‚Äù In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Avenatti said the president‚Äôs tweet calling the sketch a ‚Äútotal con job‚Äù could lead to a defamation lawsuit. Mr. Avenatti said the president ‚Äúhas now effectively called my client a liar‚Äù and accused Ms. Clifford of ‚Äúperpetrating a con.‚Äù Mr. Avenatti said he will decide in the coming days whether to pursue a such a claim. David A. Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, said Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweet on Wednesday was not likely to have an impact on his legal problems. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it hurts him,‚Äù Mr. Super said, because Mr. Trump tweeted about information that is in the public domain and does not reveal inside knowledge that only he would know. Mr. Super said a defamation suit was probably a ‚Äústretch.‚Äù At this point, Mr. Super said, Ms. Clifford is a public figure and therefore would have to prove that Mr. Trump knew he was being dishonest or reckless when he said the sketch amounted to a ‚Äúcon job.‚Äù Advertisement ‚ÄúOf his tweets, I think it‚Äôs one of the better designed, one of the less self-destructive,‚Äù Mr. Super said.

Business,"Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMAY 3, 2018, 4:58 P.M. E.D.T.  BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. ‚Äî  California Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday urged greater cooperation with China to resolve a trade dispute, while taking an apparent swipe at President Donald Trump. ""Globalization is here. We are not going to get rid of it. And a trade war is stupid,"" Brown said. Speaking Thursday at the annual California-China Business Summit in Beverly Hills, Brown said as the world's two largest economies, the United States and China are inextricably linked through business, climate and security issues. He said both need to rise above the conflict and work together in an ever-shifting global economy. ""No tariff, no little trade dispute or big trade dispute is going to stop us,"" Brown said. ""The stuff that's not working today, let's figure out how to make it work."" The governor spoke as Chinese and U.S. officials met in Beijing in an attempt to resolve a dispute that has taken the countries the closest they've ever come to a trade war. Advertisement The Trump administration has threatened to impose new tariffs on roughly $150 billion in Chinese goods, which prompted China to announce its own tariffs on U.S. products. Advertisement At one point, in what appeared to be a reference to Trump's presidency, Brown assured the business leaders that ""this too will pass."" ""I'm not telling you what I'm referring to,"" Brown said, eliciting laughter from the audience. In another apparent dig, Brown said the two countries have great potential as future trade partners but ""all you need is a great leader.""  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The annual conference is intended to promote stronger ties between Chinese business officials and industry leaders in California.

He warned that a bitter trade war would harm both counties, while disrupting the international supply chain. ""Trade war inflicts mutual disruption,"" he said. ""To avoid it, the only way is to seek win-win solutions through negotiation ... rather than confrontation."" Brown, a frequent Trump critic, argued that it was in the interest of California's massive economy, among the world's largest, to maintain strong ties with China.

Politics,"Advertisement Supported by By Michelle Goldberg In his 2014 book ‚ÄúNothing Is True and Everything Is Possible,‚Äù Peter Pomerantsev describes modern Russia as a decadently surreal place where the ruling regime fuses propaganda with over-the-top entertainment to systematically distort and recreate reality. Pomerantsev, the British son of Russian √©migr√©s, had worked in Russia‚Äôs state-controlled television industry, and portrayed it as a hypnotic circus full of wild, melodramatic extremes. Rationality, he wrote, ‚Äúwas tuned out, and Kremlin-friendly cults and hatemongers were put on prime time to keep the nation entranced, distracted, as ever more foreign hirelings would arrive to help the Kremlin and spread its vision to the world.‚Äù We still don‚Äôt know the details of Donald Trump‚Äôs possible collusion with Russia, but as a result of his election, the febrile atmosphere Pomerantsev described has spread to the United States. Our politics feel dreamlike in their garish improbability; a running joke on Twitter is that the showrunners for this season of America have jumped the shark. Nothing exemplifies this more than the strange saga of Anastasia Vashukevich. She is a Belarusian woman, a self-described ‚Äúsex expert,‚Äù who is now in a Thai jail and who claims, in a desperate Instagram video, to be the ‚Äúthe missing link in the connection between Russia and the U.S. elections.‚Äù It sounds, of course, like an outrageous scam, and perhaps it is. But Vashukevich, who goes by the alias Nastya Rybka, has a documented link to Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch who figures prominently in one of the scandals surrounding the Trump campaign. Indeed, that link may be why she‚Äôs locked up in the first place. Whether you believe her or not, her bizarre, sordid story offers real clues to the chain connecting Trump‚Äôs circle to the highest level of the Russian government. Vashukevich first came to the attention of close watchers of the Trump-Russia story last month, thanks to a 25-minute video by Aleksei Navalny, a Russian dissident famed for exposing corruption in his country. Like many domestic opponents of Russian president Vladimir Putin, Navalny had regarded the American uproar over Trump‚Äôs Russia ties skeptically. But his investigation ‚Äî which he said led to the ‚Äúmost scandalous findings in the history of our work,‚Äù according to the video‚Äôs English-language subtitles ‚Äî appears to have altered his thinking. It began last September, when a group of women in scanty bondage gear walked into the Moscow office of Navalny‚Äôs organization, the Anti-Corruption Foundation. At that very moment, journalists from a pro-Putin media outlet just happened to be passing by, and recorded their presence. Navalny wanted to find out who the women were and who had sent them. He discovered that they were, as he put it in the video, a ‚Äúmildly insane‚Äù squad of activist sex workers who specialize in weird pranks, like picketing the American Embassy naked in support of Harvey Weinstein. And one of them, Vashukevich, had lots of photographs of herself and the politically powerful Deripaska on her Instagram account. Deripaska, remember, is the oligarch that the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort offered to brief privately on the American presidential campaign. He‚Äôs been connected to Russian organized crime, and Manafort appeared to owe him a lot of money. (A court filing in the Cayman Islands said Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, couldn‚Äôt account for nearly $19 million that they were supposed to invest for a business controlled by Deripaska.) After joining the Trump campaign, Manafort emailed an intermediary, asking, apparently in reference to Deripaska, ‚ÄúHow do we use to get whole?‚Äù Navalny initially dismissed speculation that Deripaska had served as a back channel between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. ‚ÄúAmong all the conspiracy theories of American mass media, this part was the most unconvincing,‚Äù he said in the video. ‚ÄúMany oligarchs are close to Putin,‚Äù and there was no evidence that Deripaska was transmitting secret intelligence to him. But then Navalny and his team looked closely at the Instagram account of Deripaska‚Äôs nubile consort. Vashukevich had posted video from an August 2016 trip to Norway on Deripaska‚Äôs yacht with several other escorts. And on that yacht was a Russian deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko. In the video, you can even hear Deripaska and Prikhodko talking about Russia‚Äôs bad relations with the United States, for which Deripaska blamed Victoria Nuland, Barack Obama‚Äôs assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Seeing it, said Navalny, ‚Äúthe pieces of this puzzle fell into place.‚Äù Within 24 hours of Navalny posting his investigation, a Russian court issued a ruling trying to block access to it. Deripaska filed a claim against Vashukevich and Aleksandr Kirillov, a self-styled ‚Äúsex guru‚Äù she‚Äôs close to, for invasion of privacy. And at some point Vashukevich and Kirillov took off for Thailand. They were arrested there last Sunday, while teaching a ‚Äúsex training‚Äù seminar for Russian tourists in the resort city of Pattaya. (The charges were working without a permit.) From what was apparently the back of an open-air police vehicle, Vashukevich made an Instagram video begging Americans for help. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to give you all the missing puzzle pieces, support them with videos and audios, regarding the connections of our respected lawmakers with Trump, Manafort and the rest,‚Äù she said, according to CNN‚Äôs translation. When the news about Vashukevich‚Äôs arrest broke, my first thought was that it was some sort of dirty trick, a sideshow designed to make the investigation into Trump‚Äôs Russian connections look ridiculous. After all, one thing we‚Äôve learned from this whole affair is that Deripaska maintains relationships with sex workers who participate in gonzo political theater. (That itself is useful knowledge in evaluating the more salacious claims in the infamous dossier compiled by the British former spy Christopher Steele.) But Vashukevich and Kirillov really are being detained, and, speaking from a police van, Kirillov told The Associated Press that he believes Russia is behind their arrests. He has reportedly sent a handwritten letter to the American Embassy in Thailand pleading for asylum in exchange for information. Navalny told The A.P. he didn‚Äôt know what to think. ‚ÄúShows like ‚ÄòHomeland‚Äô begin to look entirely realistic when you look at what is happening in Russia now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe thought the scriptwriters made the most impossible things up, but in Russia the most absurd things are possible.‚Äù They are in America, too. Could a social-media-obsessed escort help explain the degrading nightmare of the Trump presidency? It seems like the preposterously lazy plot of a sub-B movie.

Technology,"Advertisement Supported by New York Today By Jonathan Wolfe Good morning on this stormy Monday. Bitcoin can make you filthy rich, but it still won‚Äôt buy you a buttered roll at your bodega. How do we know? We tried. For 36 hours last week I lived on Bitcoin alone. Surviving on the cryptocurrency, even in one of the world‚Äôs financial capitals, wasn‚Äôt easy. It required long subway rides to far-flung vendors where I was often the first Bitcoin-paying customer. To get started, I bought 0.00737523 Bitcoin ($50) on Coinbase, a popular cryptocurrency exchange. It took an hour, $1.99 in fees, uploading a photo ID, and calling my bank after the charge was flagged as possibly fraudulent. Coinbase also canceled my first attempt to buy the volatile currency because the price had fluctuated in the 10 seconds or so it took me to check out. I went to bed and woke up with Bitcoin worth $50.14 in my digital wallet and a list of things to accomplish: grocery shop, do laundry, buy socks, work out and get a haircut. But first, I needed coffee. The closest place I found was Kavasutra in the East Village, a 30-minute subway ride away. (The subway does not accept Bitcoin, so to ride I had to cheat.) After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn‚Äôt work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa‚Äôs Facebook account, and then gave up. But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day. Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice. I was invoiced by email for a load of laundry at the Eco Laundry Company in Chelsea. I texted with a hair stylist in Israel who accepted a tip on behalf of his colleague at Armando Pi√±a Hair Salon on the Upper East Side. I waited ‚Äî fingers crossed ‚Äî for five minutes before a payment finally posted and I could dig into an ice cream sandwich at Melt Bakery on the Lower East Side. And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes. It was fun, until I got hungry. I had searched for restaurants and grocery stores using Coinmap, the Blockchain Wallet and filters on Yelp, but almost none took Bitcoin, and most said they never had. ‚ÄúNo one is really using it the way it‚Äôs supposed to be used, as a currency,‚Äù said Dan Sim, who accepts Bitcoin at his Lean Crust pizza shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Circa 2013, he said, he‚Äôd process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that‚Äôs dropped to zero. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want to part with their Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. I couldn‚Äôt find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel. I headed to Sweetgreen. Its restaurants don‚Äôt accept cash, but they still take good old-fashioned plastic. Here‚Äôs what else is happening: We‚Äôd pay a pretty penny for better weather. We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning. Today‚Äôs high is around 60.

This week in 1912, around 700 people stepped off the Carpathia steamship at Pier 54 in the meatpacking district. They were the only survivors of the Titanic, which had sunk on April 15, claiming over 1,500 lives. On the central beam of the pier, you can still read the lettering of the shipping companies ‚ÄúCunard,‚Äù which operated the Carpathia, and ‚ÄúWhite Star,‚Äù which owned the Titanic. The Titanic left its mark on other places in the city as well. ‚Ä¢ Many of the surviving crew members were first received at the Lower Manhattan Seamen‚Äôs Friend Society, which was dedicated to improving the ‚Äúsocial, moral and religious condition of seamen‚Äù and is now the Jane Hotel. ‚Ä¢ Memorials to those who perished include Straus Park, a small park at Broadway and 106th Street dedicated to Isidor and Ida Straus; the William T. Stead Memorial in Central Park at 91st Street, honoring a British journalist who died helping others escape; and a plaque for Edith Corse Evans, a New York socialite and one of the few women from first class who died, at Grace Church in Greenwich Village. ‚Ä¢ And the white Titanic Memorial Lighthouse, built a year after the tragedy, stood atop the Seamen‚Äôs Church Institute until 1967, when it was moved to Titanic Memorial Park near South Street Seaport.
